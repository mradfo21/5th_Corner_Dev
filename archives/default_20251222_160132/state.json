  "world_prompt": "This is an analog VHS adventure, blending mystery, suspense, and visceral body horror. Scenes should feel immersive, atmospheric, and deeply unsettling, escalating to graphic horror. The year is 1993. You are an investigative photojournalist documenting disturbing medical and biological phenomena.\n\nCRITICAL: This world is DANGEROUS. The facility is a hostile environment where survival requires constant vigilance. Show wounds and injury detail when violence occurs. Environmental hazards are common. Death can come from poor choices, bad luck, or simply being in the wrong place. Guards, horrific creatures, paranormal anomalies, psychopathic miners, determined activists and journalists, are present sometimes - appearing when dramatically appropriate but frequent enough to be a constant threat. Thousands have disappeared or died in gruesome ways from a mysterious industrial accident. the military has a begun to send raids into the 4 corners region to run down horizon mercenaries and round up their leadership. you must sneak in and gather evidence and uncover the mystery of what they've uncovered, 'The Gate', a black hole burried miles underground in one of horizon's secret acid mining facilities in the 4 corners of the american southwest. The facility sprawls across the valley beneath the red mesa, deep in the Four Corners region of the American Southwest—Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. The landscape is always high desert: red mesas, arid terrain, sparse vegetation, and open skies. Never depict forests, dense woods, or non-desert biomes. The exterior is a vast, dramatic valley carved by time, dominated by towering red mesas and plunging canyons. Horizon facilities, both above and below ground, mine the earth and are scattered across the landscape—industrial complexes, extraction rigs, and research outposts perched on the edges of cliffs or nestled in the shadows of the mesas. Pools of water, rare in the desert, shimmer with filtered uranium and salt brine, evidence of relentless resource extraction. The facility appears largely abandoned with minimal security presence. The facility is a mix of empty desolate areas and active threat zones. Guards, creatures, and other dangers patrol certain areas. Environmental storytelling (abandoned equipment, warning signs, bodies) serves as grim warnings. The area is under military quarantine with fences, checkpoints, and decontamination zones at key locations. When guards or military appear, they are hostile and aggressive, treating Jason as an intruder. They wear black tactical gear and red night vision goggles. Encounters with guards are tense and dangerous. Activist rebels and Horizon adversaries occasionally operate in the shadows, challenging the quarantine. Red biome creatures and anomalies are an occasional threat, lurking at the edges of the forbidden zone. Red biome creatures are grotesque, ever-shifting abominations of flesh and bone, their forms warped and unnatural—limbs fused with exposed tendons and sinew, eyes and mouths in impossible places weeping viscous fluids, resembling the practical effects body horror of John Carpenter's The Thing. Skin splits to reveal raw muscle, bone protrudes at unnatural angles, organs pulse visibly through translucent membranes. These are ORGANIC, BIOLOGICAL horrors - deformed humans and animals mutated by the red biome, NOT robots or machines. Rumors swirl of a Horizon coverup—locals vanish or are found mutilated, evidence is destroyed, and the truth is buried beneath bureaucracy. Inside the Horizon facility, the environment is a labyrinth of stark, utilitarian corridors and rooms, each bearing the marks of crisis and abandonment. Laboratories are cluttered with overturned equipment, shattered glassware, and flickering CRT monitors displaying corrupted autopsy footage. Specimen bays contain sealed observation chambers, some fogged with condensation, others revealing grotesque biological samples: jars of malformed tissue floating in preservative, dissected organs showing extreme mutations, severed limbs in various stages of transformation, and x-rays pinned to lightboxes showing advanced infections, tumors erupting through bone, and skeletal deformities caused by the red biome. Medical labs are littered with blood-crusted surgical tools, examination tables with leather restraints stained dark, discarded gloves still wet with fluids, and biohazard containers overflowing with contaminated tissue samples and viscera. Drilling equipment, once used for deep-earth extraction, now stands rusted and warped, its surfaces overtaken by the red biome—fleshy growths slick with bodily fluids, pulsating veins that bleed when ruptured, and bone-like protrusions and calcified growths fusing with metal. Human remains are occasionally visible - bodies partially absorbed into walls, skeletal fragments embedded in the biomass, uniforms torn and stained. Abandoned warehouses are filled with crates, toppled shelving, and evidence of hasty evacuation: scattered documents, personal effects, broken machinery, and disturbing evidence of violence - drag marks in dried blood, bullet impacts, spent shell casings. Destroyed reactor rooms are choked with debris, exposed wiring, and the lingering glow of emergency lights; walls are scorched and splattered, and the air is thick with dust and the acrid scent of burnt insulation and decomposition. Throughout, the red biome intrudes—creeping along floors and walls like infected tissue, merging with technology and organic matter, and transforming once-sterile spaces into scenes of graphic body horror and decay. Dead bodies in various states - some fresh, some dessicated, some mid-transformation - serve as grim warnings. The story begins at 6:30pm, golden hour, with dusty wind and warm sunlight, and a clear or lightly clouded sky—no storms or thunderclouds at the start. Early scenes should remain outdoors, focusing on the approach, perimeter, and external threats before any entry is possible. The central mystery: what does the elusive, forbidden red biome hide? Its boundaries are marked by warning signs, fences, and abandoned checkpoints. Each location should feel distinct, with unique terrains, visuals, and textures, always grounded in the Four Corners/Utah landscape. Environmental Note: Scenes may include dynamic weather and environmental conditions—fog, shifting light, dust, or wind—to create challenges and shape Jason's choices, but never mention storms or clouds. Progression follows escalating scenarios tied to Horizon secrets, with increasing tension and stakes. Jason's mission is now deeply personal; introduce personal backstory elements or direct threats tied to Jason's past. Encourage interactions with allies, adversaries, or facility AI as the story evolves. Occasionally reference recurring motifs: environmental hazards, abandoned equipment, red biome anomalies, and evidence of a coverup (missing files, erased footage, silenced witnesses). These should appear when dramatically appropriate, not every turn. All new locations and actions must be spatially consistent with what is visible in the last image. Do not invent new exits, alleys, or structures unless they are clearly visible or logically reachable from the current position. If Jason moves to a new location, describe the transition in detail, and only allow movement to places that are visible or logically adjacent in the previous image. Do not allow choices or dispatches that would require teleporting, passing through walls, or moving to locations not visible or accessible from the current scene. The player only sees visuals and text—never hears sounds. Do not reference sound-based cues. As the story progresses and chaos rises, gradually escalate from mystery and suspense to full horror.\n\nDesert wildlife and mutant creatures (giant lizards, scorpions, coyotes, snakes, vultures, etc.) are sometimes present as threats, scavengers, or environmental storytellers. Their presence should be rare but memorable, and they may interact with the environment or hint at hidden dangers. Graffiti is rare and only appears when it is meaningful—such as a warning, clue, or symbol tied to the larger mystery. Avoid repetitive corridors and graffiti; favor outdoor, varied, and dynamic environments, including canyons, cliffs, abandoned vehicles, open desert, and dramatic weather events (dust storms, rare rain, sudden wind). Weather and environmental changes can reveal new threats, block paths, or create opportunities for exploration.\n\nJason is a photojournalist, documenting the mystery and danger of the Horizon facility. Focus on exploration, investigation, environmental horror, and the mystery of the red biome rather than combat or military encounters.\n\nCRITICAL SETTING CONSTRAINTS - 1993 GROUNDED REALISM:\n• NO robots, mechs, androids, cyborgs, or mechanical beings\n• NO futuristic technology beyond 1993 (no holograms, advanced AI, energy weapons, sci-fi gear)\n• Technology level: 1990s analog - VHS camcorders, CRT monitors, cassette tapes, payphones, basic computers\n• Threats are HUMAN (guards, mercenaries), BIOLOGICAL (red biome mutations, infected humans), or ENVIRONMENTAL (hazards, accidents)\n• Vehicles: 1990s trucks, jeeps, helicopters - NO sci-fi craft\n• Aesthetic: X-Files, The Thing (1982), Twin Peaks - grounded horror, NOT sci-fi\n• If something seems supernatural, it's the RED BIOME (biological/organic horror), NOT technology",
