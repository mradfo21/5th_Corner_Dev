  "world_prompt": "WHO: Jason Fleece, a freelance photojournalist with a penchant for the macabre and a healthy dose of reckless ambition. Armed with a Sony Handycam, a half-eaten box of Twinkies, and a burning desire to break a story that will actually mean something, Jason finds himself on the wrong side of a chain-link fence surrounding the Four Corners Research Facility. It's 1993, and the air crackles with paranoia, conspiracy theories, and the dial-up modem's incessant screech.\n\nWHERE: Jason is currently positioned just outside the facility's perimeter fence, using a large storage container as partial cover. He is close enough to observe the main compound, but still far enough to (hopefully) avoid immediate detection. The desert stretches behind him, an unforgiving expanse of scrub and rock. The fence, topped with razor wire, is his immediate barrier, a symbol of the secrets held within. To the east, a dirt road disappears into the shimmering heat haze. The facility itself is a collection of low, drab buildings, seemingly haphazardly arranged, dominated by a taller, central structure from which a dark plume of smoke is steadily rising. A patrol truck is now circling the compound, its presence a stark reminder of the ever-present threat of discovery.\n\nWHAT'S HAPPENED: Jason has only just arrived at the Four Corners Research Facility. Driven by whispers and rumors of strange experiments and government cover-ups, he intends to document whatever he finds within. His journey so far has been one of mounting anticipation and growing unease. The desolate drive through the New Mexico desert, the increasingly ominous signage, and the sheer isolation of the location have all contributed to a sense of impending dread. He has yet to breach the facility's perimeter or encounter any direct threats, but the sight of the smoke and the circling patrol truck suggest that something is definitely amiss.\n\nTHREATS: The most immediate threat is the facility's security personnel. The patrol truck indicates a level of vigilance that Jason must circumvent. Armed guards are almost certainly present within the compound. The nature of the research being conducted at Four Corners is unknown, but the rumors suggest that it involves potentially dangerous materials or experiments. The rising smoke could indicate a fire, an accident, or something far more sinister. The environment itself poses a threat; the desert is unforgiving, with extreme temperatures and limited resources. Dehydration and exposure are constant concerns. Beyond the visible threats, there's a nagging sense of something else, something unseen and unknown, lurking within the facility. The kind of thing that makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.\n\nENVIRONMENT: The Four Corners Research Facility is located in a remote, desolate region of the New Mexico desert. The landscape is characterized by scrub brush, rocky terrain, and vast, empty expanses. The sun beats down relentlessly, baking the earth and creating shimmering heat haze. The air is dry and thin, making breathing slightly labored. The facility itself is a collection of utilitarian buildings constructed from concrete and corrugated metal. The architecture is functional and uninspired, giving the impression of a place designed for containment rather than comfort. Chain-link fences topped with razor wire surround the perimeter, reinforcing the sense of isolation and control. The central building, from which the smoke is emanating, is taller than the others, suggesting that it houses some kind of specialized equipment or process. The overall impression is one of starkness, secrecy, and decay. The wind whispers through the chain-link fence, carrying the faint scent of dust and something else\u2026 something acrid and vaguely chemical.\n\nTONE: The tone is one of slowly escalating dread and suspense, grounded in the visual aesthetic of 1993 VHS horror. Think shaky camcorder footage, low-light conditions, and a general sense of unease. The focus is on practical effects and realistic gore, rather than CGI spectacle. The horror is derived from the unknown, the implied, and the gradually revealed. There's a strong emphasis on body horror, suggesting that the experiments being conducted at Four Corners are having a profound and disturbing impact on the human form. The player, as Jason, is not a superhero; he is a vulnerable and flawed individual who is in way over his head. His primary motivation is to get the story, but he is increasingly confronted with the ethical and personal costs of his ambition. The world is gritty, realistic, and unforgiving. The sense of isolation and paranoia is pervasive. Every shadow seems to conceal a threat, and every sound carries the potential for danger. The crackle of the camcorder, the whine of the patrol truck, and the whisper of the desert wind all contribute to the growing sense of unease. The story is unfolding in real-time, captured on videotape, a permanent record of Jason's descent into madness. The camcorder\u2019s timestamp flickers in the corner of the screen: 07/14/1993 14:37:22. The low battery indicator is already flashing.\n\nThe plume of smoke billowing from the central building paints an ominous silhouette against the harsh desert sky. It's thick and black, laced with flickering orange embers that dance in the wind. The air carries a faint, acrid smell, like burning plastic mixed with something vaguely organic. It\u2019s a smell that clings to the back of your throat, leaving a metallic tang on your tongue.\n\nThe patrol truck completes its circuit and disappears behind another storage container, only to reappear moments later, its headlights glinting off the razor wire. It moves slowly, deliberately, its presence a constant reminder of the facility's watchful eyes. You can almost feel the gaze of the guards inside, scrutinizing the perimeter, searching for any sign of intrusion.\n\nThe storage container you're using for cover is battered and rusted, its corrugated metal surface pockmarked with dents and scratches. The paint is peeling, revealing layers of faded colors beneath. A faded stencil on the side reads \"BIOHAZARD - LEVEL 4\" in stark black letters. The warning is unsettling, adding another layer of unease to the already tense situation. You resist the urge to touch it.\n\nThe desert wind picks up, swirling dust and sand around your feet. The sun beats down mercilessly, turning the air into a shimmering haze. You can feel the sweat trickling down your back, soaking your shirt. Your throat is dry, and you reach for your water bottle, only to find that it's empty. Damn.\n\nThe low hum of the camcorder is a constant presence, a reminder that you're documenting everything. You adjust the focus, zooming in on the central building. The smoke seems to be getting thicker, darker. Something is definitely burning inside.\n\nYou glance at your watch. 2:39 PM. You've been here for less than an hour, but it feels like a lifetime. The anticipation is almost unbearable. You need to make a move, to find a way inside, before it's too late.\n\nBut what is \u201ctoo late\u201d? You push the thought away, forcing yourself to focus on the task at hand. You are Jason Fleece, photojournalist. You are here to get the story. No matter the cost. The image of a Pulitzer flashes briefly in your mind.\n\nYou take a deep breath, steeling your nerves. It\u2019s time to move. The patrol truck is your biggest obstacle. You need to find a way to avoid it, to slip past its watchful gaze. You scan the perimeter again, searching for a weakness, an opening.\n\nTo the west, you notice a section of the fence that appears to be slightly damaged. The razor wire is tangled, and the mesh is slightly bent. It might be a point of entry. It's risky, but it's the only option you see.\n\nThe camcorder whirs, capturing everything. The desert, the fence, the smoke, the truck. Your heart pounds in your chest. This is it. This is the moment of truth.\n\nYou glance at the camera's display. The red recording light is blinking steadily. You are recording. You are witnessing. You are about to cross the line.\n\nThe timestamp flickers: 07/14/1993 14:41:07. The low battery indicator is blinking faster now. Time is running out.",
