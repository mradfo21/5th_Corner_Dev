  "world_prompt": "Jason Fleece, a photojournalist in 1993, finds himself immersed in a chilling investigation within the desolate expanse of the Four Corners region, documenting the disturbing medical and biological phenomena emanating from a clandestine Horizon facility. The facility sprawls across the valley beneath the red mesa, deep in the Four Corners region of the American Southwest—Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. The landscape is always high desert: red mesas, arid terrain, sparse vegetation, and open skies.\n\nJason is currently moving along the perimeter fence surrounding a section of the Horizon facility. He's just closed a biohazard container he examined, its contents hinting at the horrors within. The latch is now secured. The wind has picked up, rattling the chain-link beside him and obscuring any sounds he might have made. A shadow moves along the mesa's edge, unseen.\n\nHis journey began with a mission to document the mysterious industrial accident that has claimed thousands of lives and led to disappearances, all seemingly connected to Horizon's operations. Whispers of \"The Gate,\" a buried black hole unearthed during deep-earth acid mining, fuel his resolve to uncover the truth. The military, now aware of Horizon's activities, has initiated raids to apprehend Horizon mercenaries and their leaders, adding another layer of danger to Jason's already perilous task. He must sneak in, gather evidence, and expose the horrors concealed within.\n\nThe world surrounding Jason is a hostile environment, demanding constant vigilance. The facility appears largely abandoned with minimal security presence, but that is misleading. It is a mix of empty desolate areas and active threat zones. Guards, creatures, and other dangers patrol certain areas. Environmental storytelling (abandoned equipment, warning signs, bodies) serves as grim warnings. Death can come from poor choices, bad luck, or simply being in the wrong place. Guards, horrific creatures, paranormal anomalies, psychopathic miners, determined activists and journalists, are present sometimes - appearing when dramatically appropriate but frequent enough to be a constant threat. The area is under military quarantine, marked by fences, checkpoints, and decontamination zones at key locations. When guards or military appear, they are hostile and aggressive, treating Jason as an intruder. They wear black tactical gear and red night vision goggles. Encounters with guards are tense and dangerous. Activist rebels and Horizon adversaries occasionally operate in the shadows, challenging the quarantine. Red biome creatures and anomalies are an occasional threat, lurking at the edges of the forbidden zone.\n\nRed biome creatures are grotesque, ever-shifting abominations of flesh and bone, their forms warped and unnatural—limbs fused with exposed tendons and sinew, eyes and mouths in impossible places weeping viscous fluids, resembling the practical effects body horror of John Carpenter's The Thing. Skin splits to reveal raw muscle, bone protrudes at unnatural angles, organs pulse visibly through translucent membranes. These are ORGANIC, BIOLOGICAL horrors - deformed humans and animals mutated by the red biome, NOT robots or machines. Rumors swirl of a Horizon coverup—locals vanish or are found mutilated, evidence is destroyed, and the truth is buried beneath bureaucracy.\n\nOutside, the landscape is a vast, dramatic valley carved by time, dominated by towering red mesas and plunging canyons. Horizon facilities, both above and below ground, mine the earth and are scattered across the landscape—industrial complexes, extraction rigs, and research outposts perched on the edges of cliffs or nestled in the shadows of the mesas. Pools of water, rare in the desert, shimmer with filtered uranium and salt brine, evidence of relentless resource extraction.\n\nInside the Horizon facility, the environment is a labyrinth of stark, utilitarian corridors and rooms, each bearing the marks of crisis and abandonment. Laboratories are cluttered with overturned equipment, shattered glassware, and flickering CRT monitors displaying corrupted autopsy footage. Specimen bays contain sealed observation chambers, some fogged with condensation, others revealing grotesque biological samples: jars of malformed tissue floating in preservative, dissected organs showing extreme mutations, severed limbs in various stages of transformation, and x-rays pinned to lightboxes showing advanced infections, tumors erupting through bone, and skeletal deformities caused by the red biome. Medical labs are littered with blood-crusted surgical tools, examination tables with leather restraints stained dark, discarded gloves still wet with fluids, and biohazard containers overflowing with contaminated tissue samples and viscera. Drilling equipment, once used for deep-earth extraction, now stands rusted and warped, its surfaces overtaken by the red biome—fleshy growths slick with bodily fluids, pulsating veins that bleed when ruptured, and bone-like protrusions and calcified growths fusing with metal. Human remains are occasionally visible - bodies partially absorbed into walls, skeletal fragments embedded in the biomass, uniforms torn and stained. Abandoned warehouses are filled with crates, toppled shelving, and evidence of hasty evacuation: scattered documents, personal effects, broken machinery, and disturbing evidence of violence - drag marks in dried blood, bullet impacts, spent shell casings. Destroyed reactor rooms are choked with debris, exposed wiring, and the lingering glow of emergency lights; walls are scorched and splattered, and the air is thick with dust and the acrid scent of burnt insulation and decomposition. Throughout, the red biome intrudes—creeping along floors and walls like infected tissue, merging with technology and organic matter, and transforming once-sterile spaces into scenes of graphic body horror and decay. Dead bodies in various states - some fresh, some dessicated, some mid-transformation - serve as grim warnings.\n\nThe story began at 6:30pm, golden hour, with dusty wind and warm sunlight, and a clear or lightly clouded sky. Now, with the sun continuing its descent, the wind is stronger, rattling the chain-link fence. Shadows lengthen and deepen across the red mesas, making it harder to discern shapes and movement. The air grows cooler, carrying with it the scent of dust and decay.\n\nThe central mystery remains: what does the elusive, forbidden red biome hide? Its boundaries are marked by warning signs, fences, and abandoned checkpoints. Each location feels distinct, with unique terrains, visuals, and textures, always grounded in the Four Corners/Utah landscape.\n\nJason's mission is becoming deeply personal; past events and direct threats tied to Jason's past may emerge. Interactions with allies, adversaries, or facility AI may occur as the story evolves. Recurring motifs—environmental hazards, abandoned equipment, red biome anomalies, and evidence of a coverup (missing files, erased footage, silenced witnesses)—will appear when dramatically appropriate, not every turn.\n\nDesert wildlife and mutant creatures (giant lizards, scorpions, coyotes, snakes, vultures, etc.) are sometimes present as threats, scavengers, or environmental storytellers. Their presence should be rare but memorable, and they may interact with the environment or hint at hidden dangers. Graffiti is rare and only appears when it is meaningful—such as a warning, clue, or symbol tied to the larger mystery. Avoid repetitive corridors and graffiti; favor outdoor, varied, and dynamic environments, including canyons, cliffs, abandoned vehicles, open desert, and dramatic weather events (dust storms, rare rain, sudden wind). Weather and environmental changes can reveal new threats, block paths, or create opportunities for exploration.\n\nThe technology level is strictly 1990s analog - VHS camcorders, CRT monitors, cassette tapes, payphones, basic computers. Threats are HUMAN (guards, mercenaries), BIOLOGICAL (red biome mutations, infected humans), or ENVIRONMENTAL (hazards, accidents). Vehicles are 1990s trucks, jeeps, helicopters - NO sci-fi craft. The aesthetic is X-Files, The Thing (1982), Twin Peaks - grounded horror, NOT sci-fi. If something seems supernatural, it's the RED BIOME (biological/organic horror), NOT technology.\n\nHe still carries the crowbar, discovered in the biohazard container. It could be a tool for prying open locked doors or containers, or a weapon for self-defense. However, it's also rusted and potentially contaminated, adding another layer of risk to Jason's endeavor. The sickly sweet odor emanating from the container lingers faintly in the air, a grim reminder of the horrors that await within the facility. Jason needs to decide whether to carry it or abandon it.\n\nRECENT EVENTS (last 10 turns):\n- exploring -> No major world state changes.\n- Check BIOHAZARD container for entry -> No major world state changes.\n\nDISCOVERED ENTITIES:\nCrowbar\n\nPLAYER'S LATEST ACTION:\n⚡ Check BIOHAZARD container for entry.",
