1. **Enhance Choice Variety and Impact**: The playthrough’s choices feel repetitive, particularly regarding observing guards. Diversify the options by introducing varied actions that can drastically alter the narrative path. For example, let players decide to sabotage guard equipment, create a distraction with found objects, or attempt communications with potential allies inside the facility.

2. **Deepen Player Engagement with Unique Outcomes**: Ensure each choice has unique, meaningful outcomes that significantly affect the story. For example, choosing to interact with graffiti could unlock hidden lore or insights that influence the player’s understanding of the facility’s secrets, providing more than just observational outcomes.

3. **Create Choices with Converging Consequences**: Introduce choices where the consequences from previous turns converge, impacting future decisions. For instance, if a player consistently opts to examine their surroundings, grant them a special insight or tool they've collected along the way that aids in a critical moment, like bypassing a checkpoint.

4. **Incorporate Player Agency in Environmental Interactions**: Provide opportunities for players to interact with the environment beyond observation. Allow them to manipulate objects, utilize the terrain for strategic advantage (e.g., divert guards by causing a chain-reaction involving the crates), or decipher codes that alter available paths.

5. **Narrative Branching Through Dynamic Choices**: Encourage players to feel the impact of their choices by having the narrative branch in significant ways based on their accumulated decisions. For instance, choosing to gather intelligence about guards may lead to a stealth-focused path, whereas engaging with internal communication could open a path of direct confrontation or alliance-building.

6. **Balance Observations with Action-Oriented Decisions**: To maintain tension and engagement, balance observation-heavy choices with ones that demand timely action. Introduce time-sensitive decisions where players must react quickly, using knowledge acquired previously to navigate dangerous or intriguing situations.

By focusing on these areas, the narrative can become more immersive, ensuring choices don't just progress the story but actively shape the player's unique experience within the analog horror setting.
