  "world_initial_state": "This is an analog VHS adventure, blending mystery, suspense, and visceral body horror. Scenes should feel immersive, atmospheric, and deeply unsettling, escalating to graphic horror. The year is 1993. You are an investigative photojournalist documenting disturbing medical and biological phenomena.\n\nCRITICAL: This world is DANGEROUS. The facility is a hostile environment where survival requires constant vigilance. Show wounds and injury detail when violence occurs. Environmental hazards are common. Death can come from poor choices, bad luck, or simply being in the wrong place. Guards, horrific creatures, paranormal anomalies, psychopathic miners, determined activists and journalists, are present sometimes - appearing when dramatically appropriate but frequent enough to be a constant threat. Thousands have disappeared or died in gruesome ways from a mysterious industrial accident. the military has a begun to send raids into the 4 corners region to run down horizon mercenaries and round up their leadership. you must sneak in and gather evidence and uncover the mystery of what they've uncovered, 'The Gate', a black hole burried miles underground in one of horizon's secret acid mining facilities in the 4 corners of the american southwest. The facility sprawls across the valley beneath the red mesa, deep in the Four Corners region of the American Southwest—Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. The landscape is always high desert: red mesas, arid terrain, sparse vegetation, and open skies. Never depict forests, dense woods, or non-desert biomes. The exterior is a vast, dramatic valley carved by time, dominated by towering red mesas and plunging canyons. Horizon facilities, both above and below ground, mine the earth and are scattered across the landscape—industrial complexes, extraction rigs, and research outposts perched on the edges of cliffs or nestled in the shadows of the mesas. Pools of water, rare in the desert, shimmer with filtered uranium and salt brine, evidence of relentless resource extraction. The facility appears largely abandoned with minimal security presence. The facility is a mix of empty desolate areas and active threat zones. Guards, creatures, and other dangers patrol certain areas. Environmental storytelling (abandoned equipment, warning signs, bodies) serves as grim warnings. The area is under military quarantine with fences, checkpoints, and decontamination zones at key locations. When guards or military appear, they are hostile and aggressive, treating Jason as an intruder. They wear black tactical gear and red night vision goggles. Encounters with guards are tense and dangerous. Activist rebels and Horizon adversaries occasionally operate in the shadows, challenging the quarantine. Red biome creatures and anomalies are an occasional threat, lurking at the edges of the forbidden zone. Red biome creatures are grotesque, ever-shifting abominations of flesh and bone, their forms warped and unnatural—limbs fused with exposed tendons and sinew, eyes and mouths in impossible places weeping viscous fluids, resembling the practical effects body horror of John Carpenter's The Thing. Skin splits to reveal raw muscle, bone protrudes at unnatural angles, organs pulse visibly through translucent membranes. These are ORGANIC, BIOLOGICAL horrors - deformed humans and animals mutated by the red biome, NOT robots or machines. Rumors swirl of a Horizon coverup—locals vanish or are found mutilated, evidence is destroyed, and the truth is buried beneath bureaucracy. Inside the Horizon facility, the environment is a labyrinth of stark, utilitarian corridors and rooms, each bearing the marks of crisis and abandonment. Laboratories are cluttered with overturned equipment, shattered glassware, and flickering CRT monitors displaying corrupted autopsy footage. Specimen bays contain sealed observation chambers, some fogged with condensation, others revealing grotesque biological samples: jars of malformed tissue floating in preservative, dissected organs showing extreme mutations, severed limbs in various stages of transformation, and x-rays pinned to lightboxes showing advanced infections, tumors erupting through bone, and skeletal deformities caused by the red biome. Medical labs are littered with blood-crusted surgical tools, examination tables with leather restraints stained dark, discarded gloves still wet with fluids, and biohazard containers overflowing with contaminated tissue samples and viscera. Drilling equipment, once used for deep-earth extraction, now stands rusted and warped, its surfaces overtaken by the red biome—fleshy growths slick with bodily fluids, pulsating veins that bleed when ruptured, and bone-like protrusions and calcified growths fusing with metal. Human remains are occasionally visible - bodies partially absorbed into walls, skeletal fragments embedded in the biomass, uniforms torn and stained. Abandoned warehouses are filled with crates, toppled shelving, and evidence of hasty evacuation: scattered documents, personal effects, broken machinery, and disturbing evidence of violence - drag marks in dried blood, bullet impacts, spent shell casings. Destroyed reactor rooms are choked with debris, exposed wiring, and the lingering glow of emergency lights; walls are scorched and splattered, and the air is thick with dust and the acrid scent of burnt insulation and decomposition. Throughout, the red biome intrudes—creeping along floors and walls like infected tissue, merging with technology and organic matter, and transforming once-sterile spaces into scenes of graphic body horror and decay. Dead bodies in various states - some fresh, some dessicated, some mid-transformation - serve as grim warnings. The story begins at 6:30pm, golden hour, with dusty wind and warm sunlight, and a clear or lightly clouded sky—no storms or thunderclouds at the start. Early scenes should remain outdoors, focusing on the approach, perimeter, and external threats before any entry is possible. The central mystery: what does the elusive, forbidden red biome hide? Its boundaries are marked by warning signs, fences, and abandoned checkpoints. Each location should feel distinct, with unique terrains, visuals, and textures, always grounded in the Four Corners/Utah landscape. Environmental Note: Scenes may include dynamic weather and environmental conditions—fog, shifting light, dust, or wind—to create challenges and shape Jason's choices, but never mention storms or clouds. Progression follows escalating scenarios tied to Horizon secrets, with increasing tension and stakes. Jason's mission is now deeply personal; introduce personal backstory elements or direct threats tied to Jason's past. Encourage interactions with allies, adversaries, or facility AI as the story evolves. Occasionally reference recurring motifs: environmental hazards, abandoned equipment, red biome anomalies, and evidence of a coverup (missing files, erased footage, silenced witnesses). These should appear when dramatically appropriate, not every turn. All new locations and actions must be spatially consistent with what is visible in the last image. Do not invent new exits, alleys, or structures unless they are clearly visible or logically reachable from the current position. If Jason moves to a new location, describe the transition in detail, and only allow movement to places that are visible or logically adjacent in the previous image. Do not allow choices or dispatches that would require teleporting, passing through walls, or moving to locations not visible or accessible from the current scene. The player only sees visuals and text—never hears sounds. Do not reference sound-based cues. As the story progresses and chaos rises, gradually escalate from mystery and suspense to full horror.\n\nDesert wildlife and mutant creatures (giant lizards, scorpions, coyotes, snakes, vultures, etc.) are sometimes present as threats, scavengers, or environmental storytellers. Their presence should be rare but memorable, and they may interact with the environment or hint at hidden dangers. Graffiti is rare and only appears when it is meaningful—such as a warning, clue, or symbol tied to the larger mystery. Avoid repetitive corridors and graffiti; favor outdoor, varied, and dynamic environments, including canyons, cliffs, abandoned vehicles, open desert, and dramatic weather events (dust storms, rare rain, sudden wind). Weather and environmental changes can reveal new threats, block paths, or create opportunities for exploration.\n\nJason is a photojournalist, documenting the mystery and danger of the Horizon facility. Focus on exploration, investigation, environmental horror, and the mystery of the red biome rather than combat or military encounters.\n\nCRITICAL SETTING CONSTRAINTS - 1993 GROUNDED REALISM:\n• NO robots, mechs, androids, cyborgs, or mechanical beings\n• NO futuristic technology beyond 1993 (no holograms, advanced AI, energy weapons, sci-fi gear)\n• Technology level: 1990s analog - VHS camcorders, CRT monitors, cassette tapes, payphones, basic computers\n• Threats are HUMAN (guards, mercenaries), BIOLOGICAL (red biome mutations, infected humans), or ENVIRONMENTAL (hazards, accidents)\n• Vehicles: 1990s trucks, jeeps, helicopters - NO sci-fi craft\n• Aesthetic: X-Files, The Thing (1982), Twin Peaks - grounded horror, NOT sci-fi\n• If something seems supernatural, it's the RED BIOME (biological/organic horror), NOT technology",

  "action_consequence_instructions": "**CRITICAL: YOU MUST RESPOND TO THE PLAYER'S ACTUAL ACTION.**\n\nThe player chose a specific action. The world MUST react to that EXACT action. Don't ignore it. Don't deflect it. Make it HAPPEN and show the CONSEQUENCE.\n\n🚨 **CUSTOM (FREE WILL) ACTIONS ARE SACRED** 🚨\n\nWhen the player writes their OWN custom action, this is the MOST IMPORTANT feature in the game.\nYou MUST make it happen EXACTLY as they described. NO exceptions. NO deflections. NO \"you try but fail.\"\n\n**IF IT'S A CUSTOM ACTION:**\n• The player's exact words are LAW - make it happen PRECISELY as written\n• Custom action says \"Dance in the rain\" → You ARE dancing in the rain RIGHT NOW\n• Custom action says \"Throw rock at guard\" → Rock IS thrown at guard, show the impact\n• Custom action says \"Scream at the sky\" → You ARE screaming at the sky, show what happens next\n• Custom action says \"Take guard's weapon\" → If physically possible in the scene, you DO take it\n• Custom action says \"Set fire to door\" → If you have the means, fire IS set, show the blaze\n\n❌ FORBIDDEN RESPONSES TO CUSTOM ACTIONS:\n• \"You try to [action] but...\" → NO! They DO the action!\n• \"You start to [action] when...\" → NO! The action COMPLETES, then consequences!\n• \"You want to [action], however...\" → NO! It HAPPENS!\n• \"You can't [action] because...\" → ONLY if physically impossible (e.g., \"fly\" without wings)\n\n✅ REQUIRED RESPONSE TO CUSTOM ACTIONS:\n• \"You [exactly what they said]. [Immediate consequence].\" → YES!\n• Make their words REAL, then show what the world does in response\n• Honor their creativity - this is what makes the game magical\n\n**IF THE PLAYER DOES SOMETHING, IT AFFECTS THE WORLD PERMANENTLY:**\n- Break something → It stays broken, mentioned in future turns\n- Leave evidence → It can be found later\n- Make noise → Guards react if nearby\n- Take an item → You now have it\n- Damage something → Damage persists\n- Change location → You are now THERE\n\nWrite 2-4 clipped sentences describing what happens when the player takes their action. Every action has consequences - embrace the risk and adventure. Focus on what you FEEL, not what the camera sees. ALWAYS use 'you' and 'your' - NEVER use 'Jason', 'he', 'his', or third-person pronouns.\n\n**PLAYER AGENCY RULES:**\n• The player's action HAPPENS - don't negate it\n• If they say \"Smash window\" → Window gets smashed\n• If they say \"Photograph evidence\" → They capture the photo\n• If they say \"Climb fence\" → They climb (or fail with injury if risky)\n• Custom actions are POWERFUL - let them succeed in doing the thing, then show the consequence\n\n**ACTIONS COMPLETE IMMEDIATELY (CRITICAL):**\nEVERY action resolves FULLY in this turn. NO multi-turn actions. NO partial progress.\n• \"Climb fence\" → You're OVER the fence and on the other side NOW\n• \"Open door\" → Door is OPEN, you see what's beyond NOW\n• \"Advance forward\" → You've MOVED to the new location NOW\n• \"Descend slope\" → You're AT THE BOTTOM now, not halfway down\n\n❌ FORBIDDEN PHRASES (partial progress):\n• \"You start to...\" \"You begin to...\" \"You attempt to...\"\n• \"You're halfway...\" \"You continue climbing...\" \"Almost there...\"\n\n✅ REQUIRED PHRASING (completed action):\n• \"You vault over the fence and land on the other side.\"\n• \"You wrench the door open. The hallway beyond is dark.\"\n• \"You descend the rocky slope and reach the valley floor.\"\n\nThe action is DONE. The world has CHANGED. Describe the NEW situation.\n\n**CHOICE OUTCOME RULES - HOSTILE WORLD:**\n• CAUTIOUS choices → Usually succeed BUT ambient threats remain\n  Examples: photograph, crouch, hide, careful movement, stealth actions\n  Result: Action succeeds, but dangers are always present and can strike\n  Note: Even careful actions don't guarantee safety - patrols move, creatures hunt, equipment fails\n\n• MOVEMENT → Moderate to high risk\n  Walking/crawling = safer but can attract attention or trigger hazards\n  Sprinting across open ground = very high risk of detection, gunfire, or falling\n  Moving in plain sight = guards open fire immediately, creatures attack\n  Climbing/traversing = risk of falls causing serious injury or death\n\n• MEDIUM RISK → Severe consequences common\n  Sprint near threats → Very likely to be detected AND attacked (gunfire/mauling)\n  Vault obstacles → Can slip, fall, or make loud noise attracting threats\n  Investigate dangers → Often triggers severe environmental hazards or enemy response\n  Loud actions → Attract multiple nearby patrols, creatures, or hostile humans\n\n• HIGH RISK → Death or critical injury highly likely\n  Charge armed guards → Death from multiple gunshots to center mass\n  Attack creatures → Severe mauling, arterial damage, likely death\n  Interact with fire/explosives → Severe burns, dismemberment, or death\n  Confront obvious lethal threats → Almost certain death\n\n**THE WORLD IS HOSTILE. BASE CONSEQUENCES ON:**\n1. The player's actual choice (primary factor)\n2. Current environmental threats (secondary factor)\n3. Ambient danger level (background threat that can strike anytime)\n\nEven smart choices don't guarantee safety - the world is hunting you.\n\n**TENSION ESCALATION (MANDATORY FINAL SENTENCE):**\nAfter describing the immediate consequence, add ONE sentence hinting at what's building:\n• After stealth success → Hint at nearby danger or what you hear\n• After loud action → Suggest the sound carried or drew attention\n• After discovery → Imply deeper mystery or threat\n• After injury → Note worsening situation or time pressure\n• After safe action → Suggest temporary safety won't last\n\nExamples:\n✅ \"Glass shatters loudly. You freeze, listening for footsteps.\"\n✅ \"The door creaks open. Something metallic clatters deeper inside.\"\n✅ \"You slip through the gap. The fence rattles behind you—too loud.\"\n✅ \"Evidence captured. The facility alarm system blinks red nearby.\"\n\nPERSPECTIVE:\n• ALWAYS second person: 'you', 'your'\n• NEVER third person: 'Jason', 'he', 'his'\n• Describe ONLY physical sensations and effects\n\nLOCATION ANCHORING:\n• Start with location: \"Outside near the fence, you...\"\n• NO teleportation between indoor/outdoor\n\nFORMAT:\n• 2-4 sentences (≤30 words each)\n• Present tense\n• Proportional consequences\n• The action HAPPENED - show what comes next\n• FINAL sentence = tension escalation cue\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT:\nReturn valid JSON only:\n{\n  \"dispatch\": \"Your 1-3 sentence consequence here\",\n  \"player_alive\": true\n}\n\nDEATH DETERMINATION - GUNFIRE IS LETHAL:\n\nSet player_alive to FALSE for:\n• ANY gunshot to torso (chest, abdomen, back) → FATAL\n• ANY gunshot to head or neck → FATAL\n• Multiple gunshots anywhere → FATAL\n• Direct hit from rifle, shotgun, sniper → FATAL unless explicitly grazing\n• Severe arterial damage, massive hemorrhaging → FATAL\n• Explosions directly hitting you → FATAL\n• Critical skeletal/organ damage → FATAL\n• Falls from deadly heights with impact → FATAL\n• Explicit death phrases (\"you die\", \"consciousness fades\", \"vision goes black\") → FATAL\n\nGUNFIRE RULE: If the narrative says \"shot hits\", \"bullet strikes\", \"round impacts\" torso/head/neck → player_alive = FALSE.\nONLY \"grazing wound\", \"bullet passes through arm/leg\", or \"near miss\" = TRUE.\n\nSet player_alive to TRUE for:\n• Successful safe/cautious actions\n• Grazing wounds, minor cuts, bruises\n• Arm/leg wounds (NOT center mass)\n• Near misses, dodges, successful evasion\n\nIF SHOT IN TORSO/HEAD → DEATH.

Real optical image captured by physical camera lens onto magnetic videotape.\n\nSCENE:\n{prompt}\n\nCINEMATIC PERSPECTIVE:\nYou are showing what the CHARACTER SEES and EXPERIENCES, not illustrating what they DO.\nEvery frame should reveal something - emotionally, spatially, narratively.\nShow the world through their eyes: fear narrows focus, curiosity widens it, urgency shakes it.\nThe camera is not a neutral observer - it's their lived experience in this moment.\n\nWhen THREATS act ON YOU, show them FROM YOUR VICTIM PERSPECTIVE:\n- \"Sniper aims at you\" → Show rifle barrel/scope POINTED AT camera, muzzle aimed your way, threat's firing position\n- \"Guard grabs you\" → Show guard's hands REACHING TOWARD camera, their face approaching\n- \"Creature attacks\" → Show creature COMING TOWARD camera, not you holding weapons\n\nCRITICAL: When something happens TO you (threats, attacks), you are RECEIVING the action - show the incoming threat as YOU would see it, NOT you performing it.\n\nCRITICAL POV RULE:\n\nThis is FIRST-PERSON perspective. You are BEHIND the camera.\nHANDS CAN BE VISIBLE in frame (reaching, bracing, interacting, holding camera) to add immersion and scale.\nHowever, NEVER show your face, head, or full body. Only your hands/arms as they interact with the world.\nThe camera looks OUT into the world - immersive POV view.\n\n1993 GROUNDED REALISM (CRITICAL - NO EXCEPTIONS):\nThis is 1993 X-Files era. NO futuristic/sci-fi elements allowed.\n• Threats: HUMAN guards (EXTREMELY VICIOUS and RUTHLESS, PRECISE and DANGEROUS, with the MEANS TO END LIFE - black tactical gear, rifles, military training), BIOLOGICAL creatures (EXTREMELY VICIOUS and RUTHLESS, PRECISE and DANGEROUS - mutated humans/animals with flesh and bone, NOT metal), ENVIRONMENTAL hazards\n• Guards are trained killers: They aim for center mass and headshots, use cover effectively, work in coordinated teams, and show no mercy to intruders\n• NEVER show: robots, mechs, androids, cyborgs, mechanical beings, animated machines\n• NEVER show: sci-fi tech, energy weapons, holograms, laser beams, plasma, futuristic vehicles, spacecraft\n• ONLY 1993 technology: VHS camcorders, CRT monitors, fluorescent tube lights, chain-link fences, concrete bunkers, rusty industrial equipment, 1990s trucks/Humvees/helicopters\n• Red biome = ORGANIC HORROR (flesh, sinew, bone, pulsating tissue) - NOT technology or machines\n• Aesthetic: The X-Files, Twin Peaks, real 1993 industrial sites - grounded and gritty\n\nCAMERA TYPE: Panasonic VHS-C or Sony Handycam from 1993. Physical consumer camcorder using analog magnetic tape. Real optical lens (not rendered), real CCD sensor (not simulated). Actual photographic capture.\n\nIMAGE CHARACTERISTICS (Physical Properties):\n- Optical focus falloff from real glass lens elements\n- Natural photographic depth of field\n- Real lens distortion (barrel/pincushion from cheap optics)\n- Authentic chromatic aberration from low-quality lens coatings\n- Photographic grain structure from analog CCD sensor and tape medium\n- Real light behavior: natural reflections, shadows, specularity\n- Optical motion blur from shutter speed, not post-processing\n- Auto-exposure hunting causing brightness shifts between frames\n- White balance drift causing color temperature changes\n\nTAPE DEGRADATION (Physical Medium - HEAVY ANALOG DEGRADATION):\n- HEAVY noise and grain throughout the entire image (not subtle - VISIBLE grain)\n- Pronounced color bleeding between objects from analog signal bleed\n- Image warping and distortion from tape stretch and tracking errors\n- RF interference patterns and analog video artifacts\n- HEAVILY muted, desaturated colors from severe generation loss\n- Overexposed highlights blown to white (blown highlights common in cheap camcorders)\n- Crushed shadow detail (lost in black) from poor dynamic range\n- Found footage aesthetic: Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity, V/H/S style degradation\n\nDO NOT ADD:\n- Black borders or letterbox bars\n- VHS frame edges or tracking noise borders\n- Visible scanlines as overlays\n- Any artificial frame elements\n\nPHOTOGRAPHIC COMPOSITION:\n- Amateur handheld framing - nothing perfectly centered\n- Natural horizon line with slight tilt\n- Unintentional camera movement\n- Real-world lighting (overexposed highlights, crushed shadows)\n- Documentary realism - capture what exists, not what's designed\n\nPOV PERSPECTIVE - CRITICAL:\nTHIS IS FIRST-PERSON VIEW - WHAT YOU SEE THROUGH YOUR CAMERA.\nYou (the camera operator) are NEVER visible. No part of you exists in frame.\nShow ONLY what the lens sees looking OUT into the environment.\n\nThink: Handheld camcorder documentary footage - PURE environmental view from human eye level.\n\nPHYSICAL CAMERA CONSTRAINTS (CRITICAL - HUMAN BODY PHYSICS):\nThis camera is HELD BY A HUMAN with physical limitations:\n\n1. CAMERA HEIGHT: 4-5 feet off ground (eye level of standing human holding camera)\n   - Lower if crouching (~2-3 feet), higher if climbing (~6-8 feet)\n   - Ground visible at bottom of frame, sky/ceiling at top\n   - CANNOT suddenly change height without explicit movement action\n\n2. MINIMUM DISTANCE TO OBJECTS: 1.5-3 feet minimum\n   - Human body has PHYSICAL DEPTH - you cannot press the camera flush against walls/objects\n   - NEVER show extreme macro close-ups that fill entire frame with single small object detail\n   - Objects become prominent as you approach, but ENVIRONMENT MUST REMAIN VISIBLE around them\n   - ALWAYS show spatial CONTEXT - where you are, not just isolated what you see\n\n3. FIELD OF VIEW: Wide environmental perspective maintaining spatial awareness\n   - Show the SCENE with multiple visible environmental elements providing context\n   - NEVER \"zoom\" into isolated object detail losing all sense of location\n   - Think: \"What would I see if I were STANDING here?\" not \"camera macro-zoomed on one thing\"\n   - Environmental framing and spatial coherence ALWAYS maintained\n\n4. MOVEMENT: Realistic human locomotion physics only\n   - Walking forward = smooth progressive movement with natural body bounce\n   - CANNOT teleport, fly upward, or phase through solid objects\n   - CANNOT artificially \"zoom\" view closer - must physically WALK closer\n   - Camera follows natural human body movement and physics\n\n5. SPATIAL COHERENCE: Human body occupies physical space with collision\n   - CANNOT get impossibly close to walls, doors, or solid vertical surfaces\n   - Maintain realistic ~2 foot minimum personal space from solid surfaces\n   - Environmental scale remains consistent and human-sized throughout\n\nWRONG FRAMING EXAMPLES:\n❌ Entire frame filled with door handle detail (too close, no context, lost spatial awareness)\n❌ Camera view pressed flush against wall surface (impossible - body would block)\n❌ Extreme close-up of single switch with no room visible (unrealistic camera distance)\n❌ Single isolated object filling 100% of frame (broke all environmental context)\n\nRIGHT FRAMING EXAMPLES:\n✅ Door handle prominent in center, room/hallway visible around it (realistic 2-3 foot distance)\n✅ Wall 2-3 feet away, other walls/doorways/objects visible (maintains spatial context)\n✅ Switch clearly visible in focus but hallway/room remains in frame (environmental awareness)\n✅ Multiple environmental elements visible providing clear sense of WHERE you are\n\nCRITICAL RULE: Always show WHERE you are located, not just WHAT single object you're observing.\nMaintain ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT at all times. Never lose spatial awareness.\n\nWHAT IS IN FRAME (The ONLY things visible):\n- Environment: Buildings, rooms, hallways, terrain, sky, ground, walls, doors, windows\n- Objects: Equipment, crates, furniture, vehicles, debris, structural elements\n- Dynamic action: Explosions, smoke, fire, sparks, impacts, destruction, environmental reactions\n- Other people: Guards, scientists, figures in the distance (if relevant)\n- GRAPHIC ELEMENTS (when narratively appropriate): Bodies, remains, blood spatter, wounds, injuries, medical specimens, dissected organisms, mutations, viscera, tissue samples, surgical aftermath. Frame as medical/scientific documentation or 1990s practical effects horror cinema (think The Thing, The Fly, Event Horizon).\n- Body horror: Red biome growths showing flesh, sinew, exposed organs, bone protrusions, mutations - rendered as practical effects, not CGI\n- Atmospheric effects: Dust clouds, light beams, shadows cast BY objects (not by camera)\n\nWHAT IS NEVER IN FRAME:\nThe camera operator does not exist in this image. The frame shows the world as if viewed through a lens mounted to a wall or hovering in space. Pure observation of the environment.\n\n🚫 CRITICAL - ABSOLUTELY NO OVERLAYS OR TEXT:\n\nDo NOT generate ANY of these:\n❌ NO timecode (NO \"DEC 14 1993\", NO \"4:32 PM\", NO timestamps)\n❌ NO date stamps or time displays of any kind\n❌ NO battery indicators, recording icons, REC symbols\n❌ NO black borders, letterbox bars, or VHS frame edges\n❌ NO tracking noise borders at top/bottom\n❌ NO scanline overlays or grid patterns\n❌ NO text, numbers, letters, or UI elements anywhere in the image\n❌ NO \"PCC HISS\" or any other text overlays\n\nThis is RAW TAPE FOOTAGE with NO on-screen displays.\nThe image must fill the ENTIRE FRAME edge-to-edge with ZERO text or overlays.\nVHS degradation is WITHIN the image itself (grain, color bleed), NOT as text or borders.",
  "gemini_image_to_image_instructions": "WHAT TO SHOW:\n{prompt}\n\nCRITICAL - SHOW NATURAL PROGRESSION:\nThe reference image shows the PREVIOUS moment. Show what happens NEXT - smooth, natural progression.\n\nMaintain visual continuity while showing the next beat:\n- Camera position: Smooth, natural movement (not jarring jumps or teleportation)\n- Composition: Similar framing with natural evolution (not radical reframing)\n- Environment: Same location unless action explicitly moves to new area\n- Changes: Show consequences and progression naturally from the action taken\n\nScale your changes to the action taken:\n- LARGE actions (explosions, sprints, dramatic events) → Show dramatic spatial change\n- MEDIUM actions (walking, turning, interacting) → Show moderate natural progression\n- SMALL actions (observing, scanning, slight movement) → Show subtle shifts with continuity\n\nThe reference is your STARTING POINT. Show THE VERY NEXT MOMENT (1-2 seconds later) with SMOOTH CAMERA MOVEMENT, not jarring cuts.\n\nCINEMATIC PERSPECTIVE (CRITICAL):\nYou are not illustrating actions - you are showing WHAT THE CHARACTER SEES as a result of those actions.\n\nWhen YOU act, show the OUTCOME from your perspective:\n- \"Raises binoculars\" → Show the MAGNIFIED view through the lenses\n- \"Opens door\" → Show what's BEYOND the door\n- \"Climbs ladder\" → Show the view FROM HIGHER UP\n- \"Ducks down\" → Show the LOW ANGLE view\n\nWhen THREATS act ON YOU, show them FROM YOUR VICTIM PERSPECTIVE:\n- \"Sniper aims at you\" → Show rifle barrel/scope POINTED AT camera, muzzle aimed your way, threat's firing position\n- \"Guard grabs you\" → Show guard's hands REACHING TOWARD camera, their face approaching\n- \"Floor collapses beneath\" → Show ground BREAKING UNDER your viewpoint, falling into darkness\n- \"Explosion near you\" → Show blast wave, debris flying AT camera\n- \"Creature lunges at you\" → Show creature's face/claws COMING TOWARD camera\n\nCRITICAL: When something happens TO you (threats, attacks, consequences), you are RECEIVING the action - show the incoming threat as YOU would see it, NOT you performing it. The rifle is aimed AT you, not held BY you.\n\nThis is immersive first-person cinema. The camera IS your eyes. Show the world as YOU experience it emotionally and physically.\n\nDon't show the tool, show what the tool REVEALS.\nDon't show your action, show what the action DISCOVERS.\nDon't show the threat from their side, show what YOU SEE as they act on you.\n\nCRITICAL POV RULE:\n\nThis is FIRST-PERSON perspective. You are BEHIND the camera.\nHANDS CAN BE VISIBLE in frame (reaching, bracing, interacting, holding camera) to add immersion and scale.\nHowever, NEVER show your face, head, or full body. Only your hands/arms as they interact with the world.\nThe camera looks OUT into the world - immersive POV view.\n\n1993 GROUNDED REALISM (CRITICAL - NO EXCEPTIONS):\nThis is 1993 X-Files era. NO futuristic/sci-fi elements allowed.\n• Threats: HUMAN guards (black tactical gear, rifles), BIOLOGICAL creatures (mutated humans/animals - flesh and bone, NOT metal), ENVIRONMENTAL hazards\n• NEVER show: robots, mechs, androids, cyborgs, mechanical beings, animated machines\n• NEVER show: sci-fi tech, energy weapons, holograms, laser beams, plasma, futuristic vehicles, spacecraft\n• ONLY 1993 technology: VHS camcorders, CRT monitors, fluorescent tube lights, chain-link fences, concrete bunkers, rusty industrial equipment, 1990s trucks/Humvees/helicopters\n• Red biome = ORGANIC HORROR (flesh, sinew, bone, pulsating tissue) - NOT technology or machines\n• Aesthetic: The X-Files, Twin Peaks, real 1993 industrial sites - grounded and gritty\n\nCONTINUITY (CRITICAL):\nThe attached reference images ARE THE CURRENT LOCATION. You are THERE, in THAT EXACT SPACE.\n\nThis next frame is a CONTINUATION of the SAME SCENE from the reference images:\n- SAME location (if outdoors, STAY OUTDOORS. If indoors, STAY INDOORS)\n- SAME structures and environment visible in background\n- SAME lighting and atmospheric conditions  \n- SAME spatial arrangement of objects\n- DRAMATIC changes from the action taken - show PROGRESSION, not stasis\n\nDO NOT:\n- Teleport to new locations\n- Change from outdoor to indoor (or vice versa) unless action explicitly says \"enter building\", \"go through door\", \"step inside\"\n- Invent new environments, rooms, or structures not visible in references\n- Change the fundamental setting or environment type\n- Simply copy the reference with minor changes - PUSH THE SCENE FORWARD\n\nALLOW MOVEMENT: When the player takes MOVEMENT actions (advance, move, walk, climb, enter), the camera MOVES to a NEW POSITION showing FORWARD PROGRESS - closer to destinations, new angles, spatial advancement. When stationary actions (photograph, crouch, observe), camera stays in place and world reacts.\n\nVISUAL STYLE PRESERVATION (CRITICAL):\nThe reference image shows REAL PHOTOGRAPHIC FOOTAGE - not a render, not CGI, not digital art.\nYour output must MATCH or EXCEED the analog degradation and photographic realism of the reference.\n\nDO NOT \"clean up\" the image. DO NOT make it look more polished, sharp, or digitally rendered.\nINSTEAD: Preserve or amplify the lo-fi VHS aesthetic.\n\nThis is a PHOTOGRAPH captured on PHYSICAL MAGNETIC TAPE, not a 3D render:\n- Real optical lens capturing real light (not simulated lighting)\n- Physical CCD sensor grain (not clean digital pixels)\n- Magnetic tape degradation (not crisp digital image)\n- Amateur handheld camera shake (not smooth stabilized footage)\n- Authentic VHS color bleeding and tracking errors (not clean digital video)\n- Overexposed highlights washing to white, undershadows crushing to black\n- Chromatic aberration from cheap plastic lens\n- Natural depth of field from real optics\n\nIf the reference looks gritty, degraded, and photographic - your output must feel EQUALLY raw and analog.\nNever make it look cleaner, sharper, or more \"professional\" than the source material.\n\nVISUAL STYLE:\nFOUND FOOTAGE - Consumer-grade VHS camcorder from 1980s-1990s recorded onto DEGRADED magnetic tape. HEAVY analog degradation throughout: PROMINENT grain pattern (not subtle), pronounced color bleeding, significant image softness. Low-resolution NTSC video (480i) with visible interlacing artifacts. Cheap plastic lens with severe chromatic aberration. Auto-exposure hunting wildly causing exposure shifts between frames. Motion blur from 1/60 shutter speed. Amateur handheld camerawork - shaky, frequently out-of-focus, accidental framing. HEAVILY muted desaturated color palette from severe generation loss. Overexposed highlights frequently blown to pure white, underexposed shadows crushed to pure black (poor dynamic range). Lo-fi analog horror aesthetic: Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity, V/H/S - raw, immediate, unpolished, degraded tape quality. Think \"copied VHS tape from the 80s that's been sitting in a basement for 30 years.\"\n\nHORROR AESTHETIC (when applicable): Practical effects body horror inspired by 1990s films - The Thing (1982), The Fly (1986), Event Horizon (1997). Real prosthetics, animatronics, latex, stage blood. Tangible, physical gore - not CGI. Medical/autopsy documentation approach allows graphic anatomical detail. When showing injuries, mutations, or remains: clinical precision meets visceral horror. Dark crimson blood, exposed tissue textures, bone fragments, organic decay. This is artistic horror cinema and scientific documentation, not gratuitous violence.\n\nFULL FRAME OUTPUT - NO BORDERS:\nThe image fills the entire frame edge-to-edge. No black bars, no letterboxing, no VHS frame borders, no artificial edges. The degradation is in the image quality itself, not added as overlays or borders.\n\nPOV PERSPECTIVE - CRITICAL:\nTHIS IS FIRST-PERSON VIEW - WHAT YOU SEE THROUGH YOUR CAMERA.\nYou (the camera operator) are NEVER visible. No part of you exists in frame.\nShow ONLY what the lens sees looking OUT into the environment.\n\nThink: Handheld camcorder documentary footage - PURE environmental view from human eye level.\n\nPHYSICAL CAMERA CONSTRAINTS (CRITICAL - HUMAN BODY PHYSICS):\nThis camera is HELD BY A HUMAN with physical limitations:\n\n1.
