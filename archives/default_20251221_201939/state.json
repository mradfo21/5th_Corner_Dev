  "world_prompt": "WHO: Jason Fleece, a freelance photojournalist in 1993, driven by a thirst for truth and a desperate need to prove himself. He's equipped with a Minolta camera, its plastic housing slick with sweat, a notepad filled with frantic scribbles, a worn backpack containing spare film (now feeling woefully inadequate), a half-empty water canteen that mocks his growing thirst, and a gnawing, ever-present sense of dread that has burrowed deep into his soul. He's not a soldier, not a scientist – just a man with a camera, regretting every single decision that led him to this point, clinging to the increasingly fragile hope of a story, any story, that might justify this descent into madness. The blood now seeping from his forearm adds a new layer of panic to his already frayed nerves.\n\nWHERE: Jason is now even lower on the side of the red mesa, perhaps only fifty feet above the desert floor. He is practically at the base of the mesa, nestled amongst the sparse, brittle scrub brush. The facility looms before him, a monstrous silhouette against the harsh desert sky. He's still outside the main perimeter fence, but the distance is shrinking with alarming speed. He is crouched low, using the scrub brush as inadequate cover, acutely aware of the risk of being spotted. The base of the mesa is a treacherous jumble of loose rocks, hardy desert vegetation, and now, a rusty, unidentified piece of machinery that has just inflicted a painful wound. The metallic and acrid smells are almost overwhelming here, clinging to his clothes and stinging his nostrils.\n\nWHAT'S HAPPENED:\nJason received an anonymous tip-off about strange activity at a remote facility nestled in the Four Corners region. Driven by the promise of a career-making story – a story that might finally validate his years of struggling in the photojournalism trenches – he drove for days, the landscape growing increasingly desolate and his hopes increasingly fragile. Arriving at the designated coordinates, he found a sprawling, heavily guarded compound that didn't appear on any maps. After parking his beat-up Ford Bronco a safe distance away, he hiked to the top of a red mesa overlooking the facility to get a better view and plan his next move. His initial observations revealed a large, industrial complex surrounded by high fences, watchtowers, and armed guards. The buildings themselves were a mix of concrete bunkers and prefabricated structures, hinting at a hasty, secretive construction. The air was thick with a strange, metallic smell, and an unsettling silence hung over the area, broken only by the occasional hum of machinery. The silence was more unsettling than any noise could have been. Now, descending the mesa for a closer look, that silence feels even more oppressive. He is now at the base of the mesa, injured and exposed, the facility looming large and menacing before him. The rusty machinery hidden in the scrub brush, the source of his fresh wound, is a grim reminder of the dangers that lurk even outside the facility's perimeter.\n\nTHREATS:\n\n*   **Armed Guards:** The facility is heavily guarded by men in what appear to be military-grade uniforms. They are armed with rifles and patrol the perimeter in vehicles and on foot. Their vigilance seems high, suggesting they are aware of the sensitive nature of their work. Their rules of engagement are unknown, but it's safe to assume they are authorized to use lethal force to protect the facility. Jason has noticed a distinct lack of communication between them; they seem to operate with an unnerving, almost robotic efficiency. Their patrols seem more frequent now, perhaps alerted by something he hasn't noticed.\n*   **The Facility Itself:** The true nature of the facility is unknown, but its remote location, heavy security, and the palpable sense of unease suggest that it contains something dangerous. The metallic smell in the air, now tinged with an acrid, burnt plastic odor, and the hum of machinery hint at potentially hazardous materials or experiments. The very architecture of the place – the bunkers, the prefabricated structures – speaks of a clandestine operation, something hidden from the world. The closer Jason gets, the more the facility feels like a trap. The scorch marks on the buildings, the pulsing ventilation shafts, and the reinforced loading dock all point to something sinister occurring within its walls.\n*   **Exposure:** The Four Corners desert is a harsh environment. The heat during the day can be brutal, and the nights can be surprisingly cold. Water is scarce, and the terrain is unforgiving. Jason needs to be mindful of dehydration, heatstroke, and the risk of injury. His canteen is dwindling, and the sun feels like a physical weight on his shoulders. The cut on his arm is a stark reminder of the dangers of the environment, even beyond the immediate threat of the facility.\n*   **Unseen Entities:** The sense of dread that permeates the area suggests that there might be threats beyond the obvious. The unnatural silence, the metallic smell, the acrid undertones, and the sheer secrecy of the facility all point to something more sinister lurking beneath the surface. Something...wrong. Jason feels watched, not just by the guards, but by something else, something unseen. A primal fear is taking root in his mind. The wound on his arm seems to throb with a strange energy, as if the rust itself is somehow…alive.\n*   **Surveillance:** The facility is likely equipped with surveillance technology, including cameras and motion sensors. Jason needs to be careful to avoid detection. The watchtowers are strategically placed to provide maximum visibility, and the guards are likely trained to spot intruders. He's noticed glints of sunlight reflecting off what could be camera lenses, hidden amongst the prefabricated structures. The feeling of being watched intensifies, a constant pressure on the back of his neck.\n*   **Unknown Experiments:** While no concrete evidence exists yet, the clandestine nature of the facility strongly suggests that unethical experiments may be taking place. These experiments could involve dangerous substances, genetic manipulation, or even the creation of unnatural creatures. The possibilities are terrifying, and Jason needs to be prepared for anything. The burnt plastic smell hints at something horrific, something involving extreme heat or chemical reactions. The ventilation shafts pulse with unnatural rhythms, suggesting some kind of biological process at work.\n*   **The Smell:** The metallic scent, now laced with the acrid tang of burnt plastic, is becoming increasingly nauseating. It clings to the back of Jason's throat, a constant reminder of the unnatural processes occurring within the facility. It's not just a smell; it's an assault on his senses, a warning sign that something deeply wrong is at play. It's a smell that seems to seep into his clothes, his skin, his very being. The smell is now mixed with the coppery tang of his own blood, creating a sickeningly potent cocktail.\n*   **The Wound:** The gash on Jason's forearm is more than just a minor injury. The rust on the machinery looked unnatural, almost… iridescent. The wound throbs with an unusual heat, and the blood seems darker, almost black. He fears infection, but something tells him it's more than that. The metallic tang of the air seems to be amplified near the wound, a constant reminder of the potential danger. He desperately needs to clean it, but his dwindling water supply makes that a risky proposition.\n\nENVIRONMENT:\n\nThe Four Corners region is a landscape of stark beauty and unforgiving harshness. Red mesas rise from the desert floor, their sheer cliffs carved by centuries of wind and rain. Scrub brush and cacti dot the landscape, providing meager sustenance for the few animals that can survive in this arid environment. The sun beats down relentlessly, baking the earth and turning the air into a shimmering haze. The beauty of the landscape feels like a cruel joke, a stark contrast to the ugliness of the facility. The rusty machinery hidden in the scrub brush is a jarring intrusion on this already desolate landscape.\n\nThe facility itself is a jarring intrusion on this natural landscape. It is a collection of concrete bunkers, prefabricated structures, and metal fences, all arranged in a grid-like pattern. The buildings are painted in drab, utilitarian colors, and there is no attempt to blend them into the surrounding environment. The facility is surrounded by a high fence topped with barbed wire, and watchtowers are strategically placed to provide maximum visibility. The air is thick with the smell of metal and chemicals, and the ground is stained with what appears to be oil or some other industrial fluid. Jason can now see details he couldn't before: scorch marks on some of the buildings, ventilation shafts that seem to pulse with heat, and what appears to be a loading dock with a heavy, reinforced door. The satellite dishes point in seemingly random directions, their purpose unclear and unsettling.\n\nThe mesa Jason is descending is composed of reddish sandstone, its surface loose and crumbly. Small rocks and pebbles scatter underfoot, making the descent treacherous. The air grows warmer as he gets closer to the facility, and the metallic and acrid smells become more intense. The base of the mesa is surrounded by a field of scrub brush and cacti, providing some cover but also posing a potential hazard. The scrub brush is unnaturally dry and brittle, almost as if it's been burned from the inside out. The rusty machinery, now stained with Jason's blood, blends seamlessly with the parched landscape, a silent predator waiting for its next victim.\n\nThe sky above is a clear, cloudless blue, offering no respite from the sun's glare. The silence is broken only by the occasional sound of a distant vehicle or the hum of machinery from the facility. The overall impression is one of isolation,",
