  "world_prompt": "WHO: Jason Fleece, a 34-year-old photojournalist, driven by a desperate need to document the truth, even if it stares back with a monstrous face. Armed with his trusty Nikon FE2, a handful of lenses, and a growing unease, he seeks to uncover the secrets hidden within the Four Corners Research Facility. The year is 1993.\n\nWHERE: Jason now stands at the edge of the chain-link quarantine perimeter, the fence a flimsy barrier between him and the unknown horrors within. The main facility buildings loom in the distance, stark against the harsh desert landscape. He's close enough to make out details: the reinforced windows, the armed figures patrolling the rooftops, the dust devils dancing near the building's base. The air is thick with a sense of foreboding, a silent scream trapped between the barbed wire and the scorching sun.\n\nWHAT'S HAPPENED: The story is just beginning. Jason has only just arrived at the perimeter, his journey fueled by whispered rumors and grainy photographs smuggled out by a disgruntled ex-employee. He's seen the images \u2013 distorted figures, unnatural growths, and eyes that reflect a chilling intelligence. He knows this isn't just a research facility; it's a cage, and something terrible is struggling to break free. He hasn't encountered anything directly, but the oppressive atmosphere is a heavy weight on his chest.\n\nTHREATS:\n\n*   **The Guards:** Figures armed with rifles patrol the rooftops and likely the grounds. They are the first line of defense, tasked with maintaining the quarantine and silencing any unwanted observers. Their alertness is unknown, but their presence is a constant threat. Their orders are likely shoot on sight.\n\n*   **The Unknown Within:** The true horrors of the Four Corners facility remain a mystery. Whispers speak of grotesque experiments, genetic manipulation gone awry, and creatures that defy human comprehension. These entities are the ultimate threat, lurking in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to escape or consume.\n\n*   **Environmental Hazards:** The Four Corners desert is a harsh mistress. Extreme heat, dehydration, and venomous creatures pose a constant threat to survival. The facility itself may contain unknown hazards, from chemical spills to radiation leaks.\n\n*   **Exposure:** Being caught near the facility will bring unwanted attention from local authorities and potentially those who want the facility's secrets to remain buried.\n\nENVIRONMENT: The Four Corners Research Facility sits nestled in the heart of the desolate Four Corners desert, a region known for its stark beauty and unforgiving climate. The facility itself is a sprawling complex of concrete buildings, surrounded by a high chain-link fence topped with barbed wire. Security cameras are mounted at strategic points, their lenses glinting in the sun. The buildings appear weathered and worn, with peeling paint and cracked windows, hinting at years of neglect or perhaps something far more sinister. Dust devils dance across the barren landscape, obscuring the details and adding to the sense of unease. The air is dry and still, carrying the faint scent of chemicals and something else, something indefinable and unsettling. The sun beats down mercilessly, turning the desert into a crucible. The facility is isolated, miles from the nearest town, making escape difficult and rescue unlikely. A single dirt road leads to the facility entrance, a stark reminder of the outside world, a world that seems impossibly distant.\n\nThe immediate area around the perimeter fence is characterized by scrub brush, loose sand, and rocky outcroppings. Discarded equipment and rusted barrels litter the ground, remnants of past construction or forgotten experiments. The fence itself is showing signs of age, with patches of rust and tears in the mesh. A narrow path, barely visible, runs parallel to the fence, suggesting that others have walked this way before. The puff of dust Jason noticed near the building's base hints at activity, perhaps a ventilation shaft or a hidden entrance. The silence is broken only by the occasional howl of the wind and the distant hum of machinery within the facility. The sky is a vast, cloudless expanse of blue, offering no respite from the oppressive heat.\n\nThe main buildings are constructed with reinforced concrete, giving them a bunker-like appearance. Windows are small and heavily barred, suggesting that they are designed to contain something, not to provide a view. The rooftops are flat and exposed, providing clear lines of sight for the guards. Satellite dishes and antennae sprout from the buildings, hinting at communication with the outside world, or perhaps something else entirely. The architecture is utilitarian and devoid of any aesthetic appeal, reflecting the cold, calculating nature of the research conducted within.\n\nThe overall impression is one of isolation, decay, and hidden menace. The Four Corners Research Facility is not a place of scientific discovery; it is a prison, a tomb, a breeding ground for nightmares. The desert itself seems to conspire to keep its secrets buried, its silence broken only by the whispers of the wind and the screams of the damned.\n\nTONE: The world is viewed through the lens of a 1993 VHS camcorder, lending a grainy, distorted quality to the visuals. Colors are muted, and the contrast is high, creating a sense of unease and paranoia. The audio is muffled and crackling, punctuated by static and the occasional glitch. The narrative is grounded in realism, focusing on the mundane details of survival and the psychological toll of witnessing the inexplicable. Body horror elements are subtly introduced, hinting at the grotesque transformations that have taken place within the facility. The overall tone is one of dread, suspense, and creeping terror, a slow burn that builds to a crescendo of unimaginable horror. The focus is on atmosphere and suspense, creating a sense of claustrophobia and helplessness. The player is not a hero; they are a witness, struggling to survive in a world that has gone horribly wrong. The past is never truly past. The facility has a history, and it is one of dark and disturbing events. Jason's investigation will unearth these events and they will come back to haunt him.",
