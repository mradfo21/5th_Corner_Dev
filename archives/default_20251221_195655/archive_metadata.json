  "world_prompt": "WHO: Jason Fleece, a freelance photojournalist driven by a fading career and a thirst for a story that can resurrect him. He's equipped with a Minolta camera, a battered backpack containing a few rolls of film, a half-eaten granola bar, and a growing sense of dread. 1993.\n\nWHERE: Lying prone on the cracked asphalt just inside the perimeter fence, a mangled section now resting on his leg. The immediate area is bathed in the harsh, unforgiving light of the late afternoon sun. The main facility buildings loom in the distance, a cluster of low, brutalist architecture against the backdrop of the desolate Four Corners desert. The air smells of dust, ozone, and something acrid, like burnt metal.\n\nWHAT'S HAPPENED: Jason arrived at the Four Corners Research Facility after receiving an anonymous tip about unusual activity and possible human experimentation. Driven by the need for a career-saving story, he ignored the official quarantine warnings and the increasingly unsettling atmosphere. He bypassed the main gate, opting for a less conspicuous entry point through a section of dilapidated fencing. This decision has just resulted in a serious leg injury. So far, he has encountered no other humans or creatures, only the oppressive silence and decay of the abandoned facility.\n\nTHREATS:\n\n*   **The Quarantine:** The official quarantine is in place for a reason. While the exact nature of the threat is unknown, the severity of the quarantine suggests something highly dangerous and potentially contagious. The warning signs posted at the perimeter are the only indication of what lies within, but they are enough to instill a sense of unease and dread.\n*   **Environmental Hazards:** The dilapidated state of the facility presents numerous environmental hazards. Unstable structures, rusted metal, exposed wiring, and potentially contaminated areas pose a constant threat to Jason's safety. The harsh desert climate, with its extreme temperatures and limited resources, further compounds these dangers.\n*   **Guards/Personnel (Potential):** Although the facility appears abandoned, there is a possibility of remaining security personnel or researchers who may be hostile to outsiders. Their motivations and level of organization are unknown, but their presence would significantly increase the danger. The anonymity of the tip suggests a clandestine operation, which could involve individuals willing to protect their secrets at any cost.\n*   **The Unknown Experiment:** The core threat remains the unknown experiment that led to the quarantine. The nature of this experiment is unclear, but the anonymous tip hinted at human experimentation, suggesting a potential for grotesque mutations, psychological horrors, or other unforeseen consequences. The silence of the facility is punctuated by an unsettling feeling of anticipation, as if something is waiting to be discovered.\n*   **Blood Loss/Infection:** The gash in Jason's leg is a significant and immediate threat. The wound is deep and bleeding heavily, increasing the risk of blood loss and shock. The rusted metal of the fence likely introduced bacteria and other contaminants into the wound, raising the possibility of a severe infection. The lack of medical supplies and the remote location make this injury a life-threatening situation.\n*   **The Elements:** The desert sun is relentless, beating down on Jason and accelerating dehydration. The temperature will plummet dramatically after sunset, exposing him to the risk of hypothermia, especially given his injured state and potential blood loss.\n\nENVIRONMENT:\n\nThe Four Corners Research Facility is a sprawling complex located in the heart of the desolate Four Corners desert. The architecture is brutalist, characterized by stark concrete structures, minimal ornamentation, and a general sense of utilitarianism. The buildings are in a state of disrepair, with cracked walls, broken windows, and overgrown vegetation. The facility is surrounded by a high chain-link fence, topped with razor wire, although sections of the fence have collapsed or been breached over time.\n\nThe surrounding landscape is a harsh and unforgiving environment. The desert is characterized by rocky terrain, sparse vegetation, and extreme temperatures. The air is dry and dusty, and the sun beats down relentlessly during the day. The nights are cold and dark, with little to no ambient light. The nearest town is several hours away, making the facility a truly isolated location.\n\nThe facility itself consists of several distinct areas:\n\n*   **The Perimeter Fence:** The outer boundary of the quarantine zone, marked by warning signs and dilapidated fencing. The fence is in a state of disrepair, with sections collapsed or breached.\n*   **The Main Buildings:** A cluster of low, concrete structures that likely housed the research laboratories, administrative offices, and living quarters. The buildings are in a state of disrepair, with cracked walls, broken windows, and overgrown vegetation.\n*   **Auxiliary Structures:** Scattered across the facility grounds are various auxiliary structures, such as storage sheds, power generators, and water towers. These structures are also in a state of disrepair and may contain hidden dangers.\n*   **Underground Tunnels (Potential):** Given the secretive nature of the research, there is a possibility of underground tunnels connecting the various buildings. These tunnels could provide access to hidden laboratories or storage areas, but they could also be filled with unknown dangers.\n*   **The Asphalt:** Cracked and broken, weeds sprouting through the gaps, stained with oil and other unknown substances. The air shimmers above it in the heat.\n\nTONE: The overall tone is one of creeping dread and VHS-era horror. The setting is grounded in the realism of 1993, with a focus on practical effects and a gritty, low-budget aesthetic. The horror is psychological, emphasizing suspense, atmosphere, and the unknown. Body horror elements are present, hinting at the potential for grotesque mutations and other physical transformations. The use of visual distortion, such as static, scan lines, and color bleeding, further enhances the VHS aesthetic and contributes to the overall sense of unease. The silence is punctuated by unsettling noises, such as wind whistling through broken windows, the creaking of metal, and the distant sound of something moving in the shadows. The environment is hostile and unforgiving, constantly reminding Jason of his vulnerability and isolation. The story unfolds slowly, building tension and suspense with each new discovery. The focus is on Jason's internal struggle as he confronts his fears and tries to survive in this nightmarish environment. The camera serves as Jason's eyes, capturing the horror through his lens and inviting the player to experience the world through his perspective. The feeling of being watched is ever-present, adding to the overall sense of paranoia and dread.",
