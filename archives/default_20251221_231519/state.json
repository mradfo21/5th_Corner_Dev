  "world_prompt": "Jason Fleece, a photojournalist haunted by the ghosts of wars he documented, finds himself in a nightmare far removed from any battlefield he’s known. The year is 1993. His mission, initially a straightforward assignment for a fringe magazine, has spiraled into a descent into the heart of a clandestine facility nestled deep within the desolate Four Corners region. He’s chasing a story about alleged government experiments, whispers of genetic manipulation, and rumors of a place where the line between life and death blurs.\n\nWHERE:\nJason now stands several feet inside a dark, overgrown corridor, the hidden gate and the perimeter fence fading behind him. The skeletal remains of the factory, once looming large, are now partially obscured by the dense foliage that presses in from all sides. The warning sign, its message a fading echo of the horrors within, is completely out of sight. The corridor is narrow and claustrophobic, formed by the decaying fence on one side and a thick wall of overgrown bushes on the other. The path ahead is shrouded in shadow, the darkness broken only by dappled sunlight filtering through the dense canopy above. The ground beneath his feet is uneven and littered with debris, making each step a calculated risk. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth, decaying vegetation, and something else… a faint, metallic tang that hangs heavy in the air.\n\nWHAT'S HAPPENED:\nJason’s journey began with a cryptic tip-off, a blurred photograph of a mutated creature, and a name: Four Corners. The drive across the arid landscape was long and unsettling, the silence broken only by the hum of his aging Toyota Camry and the crackle of his police scanner, tuned to frequencies that yielded nothing but static. As he approached the facility, the atmosphere grew heavy, the air thick with an almost palpable sense of dread. The landscape itself seemed to conspire against him, the wind howling like a tormented spirit, the shadows stretching and contorting into grotesque shapes. He arrived at the perimeter fence, where he discovered a battered warning sign, its message obscured by bullet holes and faded paint. A rusted key, seemingly placed by chance, lay nearby. He carefully read the sign, gleaning what information he could from the fragmented message. Compelled by a mixture of morbid curiosity and journalistic ambition, he tried the key on a hidden gate concealed within the foliage. With a groan of protesting metal, the lock yielded, and the gate swung inward, revealing the dark and ominous path he now treads. The initial warning, the discovery of the key, and the unlocking of the gate have deepened the mystery and heightened the sense of impending doom. He has now crossed the first threshold, leaving behind the relative safety of the outside world. The metallic clang that echoed from deeper within the facility serves as a chilling reminder that he is not alone.\n\nTHREATS:\nThe most immediate threat remains largely unknown, but the unlocked gate and the encroaching darkness introduce new layers of uncertainty. The warning sign hinted at a quarantine zone and armed conflict, but the nature of the threat within remains shrouded in mystery. The bullet holes suggest armed resistance, perhaps from those trying to escape, or those attempting to contain the horrors within. The environment itself is still a threat, the harsh desert climate unforgiving. Dehydration and exposure are constant concerns, especially now that he is further inside the facility grounds. The psychological toll is also mounting. The isolation, the oppressive atmosphere, and the unsettling feeling of being watched are amplified by the claustrophobic nature of the overgrown corridor. The rusted key, while providing access, may have led him into a trap, drawing him deeper into danger. The whispers of genetic experiments suggest the possibility of mutated creatures, beings warped and twisted by science gone mad. And then there are the guards, or what remains of them. Are they still active? Are they human? Or have they, too, succumbed to the horrors of Four Corners? The unlocked gate could also mean that whatever is inside can also get out. The darkness ahead conceals untold dangers, and the sound of the gate swinging open may have alerted something to his presence. The overgrown vegetation itself could be hiding something, a creature lurking in the shadows, or a trap waiting to be sprung. The metallic clang, now echoing in his mind, suggests the presence of machinery, or perhaps something more sinister. The uneven ground and the dense foliage make it difficult to move quietly, increasing the risk of attracting unwanted attention. The air is heavy with a sense of foreboding, a feeling that something is watching him, waiting for him to make a mistake. The darkness is not empty; it is a living, breathing entity that seeks to consume him.\n\nENVIRONMENT:\nThe Four Corners region is a land of stark beauty and unforgiving terrain. Towering mesas cast long shadows across the parched earth, the sun beats down with relentless intensity, and the wind carries whispers of forgotten secrets. The facility itself is a sprawling complex of interconnected buildings, a labyrinth of corridors, laboratories, and storage rooms. The architecture is utilitarian, designed for function rather than aesthetics, a reflection of the cold, clinical nature of the experiments conducted within. The exterior is scarred and weathered, a testament to years of neglect and abuse. Broken windows, crumbling walls, and rusted machinery litter the landscape. The perimeter fence, though damaged, still serves as a partial barrier, a symbol of containment and isolation. The newly discovered gate, now ajar and receding behind him, represents a breach in that containment. The air is thick with the smell of decay, a mix of dust, rust, and something else, something indefinable and deeply unsettling, now mingled with the scent of damp earth and decaying vegetation. The skeletal remains of the factory dominate the skyline, a grim reminder of the facility's past and a chilling premonition of its present, though they are now largely obscured by the encroaching vegetation. The dust kicked up by the wind is fine and red, coating everything in a layer of grime. The soundscape is dominated by the wind, punctuated by the occasional creak of metal and the distant howl of some unknown creature, now overlaid with the echo of the gate's rusted hinges and the more recent, unnerving metallic clang. The light is harsh and unforgiving outside, but within the corridor, it is dim and flickering, creating a sense of unease and uncertainty. The vegetation is thick and tangled, obscuring the path ahead and creating a sense of claustrophobia. The ground is uneven and littered with debris, making it difficult to move quietly. The air is heavy with moisture, a stark contrast to the arid desert outside, suggesting a hidden source of water within the facility. The corridor is a tunnel of green and brown, a claustrophobic passage that leads deeper into the heart of darkness.\n\nTONE:\nThe world is steeped in the aesthetic of 1993 VHS horror. Think grainy footage, flickering lights, and a pervasive sense of dread. The realism is grounded, focusing on the physical and psychological toll on Jason as he navigates this nightmare. Body horror elements are subtly introduced, hinting at the grotesque transformations that have taken place within the facility. The narrative unfolds slowly, building tension and suspense with each new discovery. The focus is on atmosphere and psychological horror, rather than cheap jump scares. The fear is palpable, a constant companion that gnaws at Jason's sanity. The world is not inherently evil, but it is indifferent, a cold and uncaring place where survival is a constant struggle. The rusted key, in its simple existence, represented a small glimmer of hope, but now feels more like a curse, leading him further into madness. The warning sign, with its fragmented message, serves as a constant reminder of the dangers that lie ahead, though it is now out of sight and fading from memory. The wind, the dust, the decaying buildings, and now the overgrown vegetation – all contribute to a sense of overwhelming dread and isolation. The facility is a mausoleum, a tomb for forgotten dreams and unspeakable horrors. The color palette is dominated by browns, grays, and reds, reflecting the harsh desert landscape and the decay that permeates the facility, with hints of green from the overgrown vegetation. The lighting is dim and flickering, creating a sense of unease and uncertainty, now further obscured by the dense foliage. The sound design is sparse and unsettling, emphasizing the silence and the occasional bursts of noise that punctuate it. The metallic clang is a new element in this soundscape, a harbinger of unknown terrors. The overall effect is one of claustrophobia, paranoia, and a growing sense of impending doom. Jason is alone, vulnerable, and trapped in a nightmare from which there may be no escape. The unlocked gate is not an invitation, but a challenge, a test of his resolve and his sanity. The darkness ahead is not empty, but pregnant with untold horrors. The overgrown corridor is a physical manifestation of his descent into madness, a winding path that leads deeper into the abyss.\n\nRECENT EVENTS (last 10 turns):\n- Intro -> No major world state changes.\n- ‍♂️ Read the warning sign carefully. -> No major world state changes.\n- ‍♂️ Try the rusted key on a nearby gate or door in the fence. -> Unlocked hidden gate, entered overgrown corridor.\n\nDISCOVERED ENTITIES:\nWarning sign, bullet holes, skeletal remains, factory, hidden gate, overgrown corridor, metallic clang (sound)\n\nPLAYER'S LATEST ACTION:\n‍♂️ Proceed cautiously into the dark opening.\n\nCONSEQUENCE OF ACTION:\nAdvanced further into the overgrown corridor, heard a faint metallic clang.",
