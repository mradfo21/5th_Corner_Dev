  "world_prompt": "Jason Fleece, a freelance photojournalist with a penchant for the macabre, found himself on the outskirts of the Four Corners Bioresearch Facility in the desolate expanse of the New Mexico desert. The year was 1993. His beat-up Ford Bronco, affectionately nicknamed \"The Roach,\" was parked a safe distance away, hidden behind a cluster of Joshua trees. The air hung thick and heavy, pregnant with the promise of a sandstorm, mirroring the apprehension twisting in Jason's gut.\n\nWHERE:\n\nJason currently stood near a rusted and dilapidated warning sign, marking the perimeter of the quarantine zone surrounding the Four Corners Bioresearch Facility. The sign, barely legible, warned of a biohazard and strictly forbade entry. The metal was corroded, the paint peeling, and the biohazard symbol was almost completely obscured by rust and age. Before him stretched a landscape of decaying buildings and overgrown vegetation, a testament to years of abandonment and neglect. A low, guttural growl emanated from within one of the closer structures, a sound that sent a shiver down Jason's spine and made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end.\n\nWHAT'S HAPPENED:\n\nSo far, Jason\u2019s journey was only just beginning. He had spent weeks researching the Four Corners facility, piecing together fragments of rumors and whispers that painted a grim picture of clandestine experiments and unexplained disappearances. Driven by a morbid curiosity and the promise of a career-defining story, he had ignored the warnings and ventured into the heart of the quarantine zone. He had only just arrived, taking his first steps into the forsaken landscape.\n\nTHREATS:\n\nThe most immediate threat was the unknown source of the growl emanating from the nearby building. It suggested the presence of a hostile entity within the facility, its nature and origin yet unknown. The quarantine zone itself posed a significant threat, suggesting the presence of a dangerous biological hazard. The very air might be contaminated. The facility, abandoned and decaying, presented its own set of dangers, including structural instability, hidden traps, and the potential for accidents. Jason also suspected that security, whether official or unofficial, might still be present, guarding the secrets of the facility and willing to use force to protect them. The possibility of encountering armed guards or other hostile individuals could not be ruled out. The isolation of the location amplified the danger, leaving Jason vulnerable and exposed.\n\nENVIRONMENT:\n\nThe Four Corners Bioresearch Facility was a sprawling complex of interconnected buildings, labs, and research facilities, now in a state of advanced decay. The buildings were constructed of concrete and steel, designed to withstand the harsh desert environment, but years of neglect had taken their toll. Windows were broken, walls were cracked, and roofs had partially collapsed. The surrounding landscape was a barren expanse of sand, scrub brush, and cacti, punctuated by the occasional Joshua tree. The air was dry and dusty, carrying the scent of decay and the faint, metallic tang of something unnatural. The facility was located in a remote and isolated area, far from any towns or settlements, adding to the sense of desolation and dread. The oppressive heat of the desert sun beat down on the facility, baking the concrete and steel, creating a stifling and claustrophobic atmosphere. The wind howled through the broken windows and cracks in the walls, creating an eerie and unsettling sound. The overall impression was one of abandonment, decay, and a sense of something profoundly wrong. The landscape itself seemed to hold its breath, anticipating some unspeakable horror. The isolation, combined with the oppressive atmosphere, created a sense of vulnerability and dread. The sky was a pale, washed-out blue, reflecting the harshness of the desert landscape. The sun beat down mercilessly, casting long, distorted shadows that seemed to writhe and twist in the heat. The air shimmered with heat haze, blurring the already indistinct outlines of the buildings. The silence, broken only by the occasional gust of wind and the unsettling growl from within the facility, was heavy and oppressive. The ground was littered with debris, including broken glass, rusted metal, and discarded equipment. The vegetation was sparse and withered, struggling to survive in the harsh environment. The overall impression was one of desolation and decay, a testament to the horrors that had taken place within the walls of the Four Corners Bioresearch Facility. The facility itself seemed to be a festering wound on the face of the desert, a monument to scientific hubris and human folly. The very ground seemed to be tainted, radiating an aura of sickness and despair. The air hung heavy with the stench of decay, a constant reminder of the horrors that lurked within the shadows. The wind whispered through the broken windows and cracks in the walls, carrying with it the echoes of screams and the whispers of madness. The sun beat down mercilessly, baking the concrete and steel, creating a stifling and claustrophobic atmosphere. The isolation, combined with the oppressive atmosphere, created a sense of vulnerability and dread. The Four Corners Bioresearch Facility was a place where nightmares came to life, a place where the boundaries between science and madness had blurred, and a place where the secrets of the past refused to stay buried.\n\nTONE:\n\nThe overall tone was one of creeping dread and mounting tension, reminiscent of a low-budget VHS horror film from the early 1990s. The emphasis was on atmosphere, suspense, and the slow reveal of disturbing details. The focus was on grounded realism, with a gritty and unpolished aesthetic. The horror was psychological, relying on suggestion and implication rather than explicit gore. The body horror elements were subtle but unsettling, hinting at the grotesque experiments that had been conducted within the facility. The sense of isolation and vulnerability was paramount, emphasizing the protagonist's precarious situation. The overall goal was to create a sense of unease and dread, leaving the player on edge and constantly anticipating the next terrifying revelation.\nThe grainy visuals, the distorted audio, and the unsettling atmosphere combined to create a truly immersive and terrifying experience.
