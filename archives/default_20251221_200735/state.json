  "world_prompt": "Jason Fleece, photojournalist, grits his teeth, the metallic tang of blood thick in his mouth. The Arizona sun, though beginning its descent, still radiates a fierce heat, amplifying the throbbing pain in his forearm. It’s 1993. He’s alone. And the Four Corners Research Facility, a monument to forgotten sins, looms before him, its shadow stretching long and menacing across the desert floor.\n\nWHERE:\nStill just inside the breached perimeter fence, kneeling in the hard-packed desert dirt. The barbed wire, now slick with his blood, hangs limply from the rusted posts. He’s applying pressure to the wound, trying to stem the flow, but the crimson stain on his sleeve is growing larger. The oppressive bulk of the facility is only a short distance away, the dark gash in its side a constant, mocking reminder of his reckless entry. The air is acrid, a mix of ozone, something rotten, and now… the coppery scent of his own blood.\n\nWHAT'S HAPPENED:\nThis is it. The culmination of months of desperate searching, fueled by the disappearance of his brother, Daniel, a former employee at Four Corners. Jason, armed with only his camera, a Minolta Maxxum 7000i, and a desperate hope, has breached the quarantine zone. The official story: a viral outbreak, contained. The truth, he suspects, is far more horrifying. He came prepared for a sterile research facility, but found an abandoned hell hole. The long, lonely drive across the desert, the growing sense of dread, the chilling sight of the facility on the horizon… all a prelude to this. He’s seen no people, no guards, only the oppressive silence and the feeling of being watched. The wound on his arm is a testament to his impatience, a foolish mistake that could cost him everything.\n\nTHREATS:\nThe most immediate threat has shifted. It's no longer just the potential for infection, but the immediate danger of whatever the blood has attracted. The low growl he heard was close, too close. He’s not alone. The facility itself remains a looming threat, a labyrinth of unknown dangers. Security personnel are still a possibility, though the absence of any visible presence is even more unsettling. The “viral outbreak,” or whatever it truly is, poses an unknown, and likely horrific, danger. The whispers he heard spoke of… experiments. Mutated subjects. Things that shouldn’t exist. The environment, the relentless sun, the coming cold of the desert night, and the lack of supplies, all conspire against him. And now, the unseen predator, drawn by the scent of blood, is the most pressing concern. The growl suggests a creature, something animalistic, but in this place, nothing is as it seems.\n\nENVIRONMENT:\nThe Four Corners Research Facility squats in the middle of the Arizona desert like a festering wound, its concrete shell a stark contrast to the natural landscape. The architecture is brutalist, all harsh angles and reinforced concrete, a monument to misguided ambition and hidden horrors. The exterior is stained with years of neglect and exposure, punctuated by flickering fluorescent lights that buzz with unnatural intensity, casting long, distorted shadows. The perimeter fence, now breached and stained with Jason’s blood, is a patchwork of rusted chain link and decaying barbed wire, a flimsy barrier that failed to contain whatever lurks within. The surrounding landscape is barren, dotted with scrub brush and the occasional Joshua tree, their skeletal arms reaching towards the sky like silent witnesses. The air is thick with dust and the oppressive heat, broken only by the occasional gust of wind that carries with it the faint, metallic tang of the facility and the now-overpowering scent of blood. The dark gash in the building’s side offers a glimpse into the interior: shadows, the glint of something metallic, and the promise of untold horrors. The ground is uneven, littered with debris: discarded equipment, broken glass, and scraps of what might have once been warning signs. The setting sun casts long, distorted shadows, transforming familiar shapes into monstrous figures.\n\nTONE:\nThe grainy, washed-out aesthetic of a well-worn VHS tape permeates everything. This isn't a high-budget action flick; this is a slow burn, a descent into madness. The horror is psychological, grounded in the stark reality of 1993 technology and the limitations of the human body. The fear is palpable, the sense of isolation crushing. The body horror is understated but ever-present, a creeping dread that festers beneath the surface. Every shadow seems to writhe, every sound echoes with menace. The camera, Jason’s only companion, becomes a lens for his paranoia, blurring the line between reality and hallucination. He is a man out of his depth, driven by desperation, and teetering on the edge of sanity. Now, that sanity is being tested by the very real threat of a creature drawn to his blood. He's no longer just facing the unknown horrors within the facility, but a predator in the desolate wasteland surrounding it. The growl is a promise of violence, a stark reminder of his vulnerability.\n\nThe blood trickling down his arm is a stark reminder of his mortality. He needs to stop the bleeding, not just for infection's sake, but to avoid attracting more unwanted attention. The facility looms, a silent invitation to a nightmare he can no longer avoid, but now he must also contend with the immediate danger lurking just beyond the fence. The sun is setting, casting long, distorted shadows that dance across the concrete walls, making it difficult to distinguish between reality and hallucination. The low hum emanating from within the facility continues, a mechanical drone that vibrates through the ground and into his bones, a constant reminder of the unnatural experiments conducted within. He can feel eyes on him, unseen but present, both from within the facility and from the creature stalking him in the desert.\n\nHe glances at his watch – a Casio digital, a relic of the era. 6:22 PM. Time is running out. The darkness will bring its own set of terrors.\n\nHe needs to make a decision, and fast. Enter the facility through the gash, or try to find another way in. He can also try to better treat the wound, but he doesn't have much in the way of supplies. The blood is drawing the attention of something. He can hear it moving closer, the sound of skittering claws on the hard-packed dirt. The facility waits, a silent predator in the fading light, but the immediate threat is the unseen creature closing in on his position. The blood continues to flow, a crimson beacon in the gathering darkness. The growl comes again, closer this time, laced with hunger.",
