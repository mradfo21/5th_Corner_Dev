  "world_prompt": "WHO: Jason Fleece. Thirty-two years old. Photojournalist. Driven by a desperate need to prove himself after a series of career missteps and fueled by the promise of a story that could resurrect his reputation. He carries a well-worn Nikon FM2 camera, a battered notepad filled with frantic scribbles, and a growing sense of dread. He is currently bleeding from a shoulder wound.\n\nWHERE: The base of the red mesa, somewhere within the sprawling perimeter of the Four Corners Research Facility. The mesa acts as a natural vantage point, but the descent proved treacherous. He is now on relatively flat, rocky ground, littered with loose shale and scrub brush. The imposing chain-link fence surrounding the facility looms perhaps a hundred yards away, a constant reminder of his intrusion. The mesa\u2019s shadow stretches long and distorted in the late afternoon sun. To the south, the main complex of the facility is visible \u2013 a cluster of low, brutalist buildings baking under the desert sun. To the north, the landscape stretches into a seemingly endless expanse of canyons and mesas, offering potential escape routes but also unknown dangers. The air is thick with the smell of dust and something else\u2026 something acrid and metallic.\n\nWHAT'S HAPPENED: Jason arrived in the Four Corners region three days ago, drawn by rumors of strange experiments and unexplained disappearances surrounding the Four Corners Research Facility. He'd staked out the perimeter, observing the facility's operations from a distance. He spotted unusual security patrols, strange deliveries, and fleeting glimpses of what appeared to be heavily guarded personnel. The secrecy surrounding the place was palpable, confirming his suspicions that something sinister was happening within its walls.\n\nYesterday, he found a weak point in the perimeter fence \u2013 a section damaged by a recent rockslide. He spent hours carefully widening the gap, using a pair of rusty wire cutters he\u2019d found abandoned near a dried-up creek bed. He slipped through the fence under the cover of darkness, navigating the treacherous terrain under the faint glow of the moon. He spent the night hiding in a shallow cave, shivering in the cold desert air, his anticipation battling with a growing sense of unease.\n\nThis morning, he ascended the red mesa, hoping to get a better view of the facility layout and plan his next move. The view was both revealing and unsettling. The facility was larger and more complex than he had initially anticipated, a sprawling network of buildings, underground bunkers (identifiable by ventilation shafts), and seemingly random outposts scattered across the landscape. From his vantage point, he observed several security checkpoints, patrolled by armed guards in what appeared to be military-grade uniforms. He also noticed a series of what looked like containment units \u2013 reinforced structures with thick, blast-proof doors. What they contained, he couldn't imagine.\n\nHis descent from the mesa was less graceful than planned.\n\nTHREATS:\n\n* **Facility Security:** Armed guards patrol the perimeter and interior of the facility. They appear to be well-trained and heavily armed, equipped with automatic rifles, communication devices, and a ruthless efficiency. They are the most immediate and visible threat. Their patrol routes seem to be somewhat predictable, but they are vigilant and will not hesitate to engage intruders. The sound of his fall might have alerted them.\n* **Unseen Entities:** The rumors that drew Jason to this place spoke of more than just government secrets. They hinted at something\u2026 unnatural. Something monstrous. The whispers of disappearances, the strange deliveries, the heavily guarded containment units \u2013 all point to the possibility of something far more dangerous than human adversaries lurking within the facility. The acrid, metallic smell in the air hints at some kind of biological or chemical experimentation.\n* **The Environment:** The Four Corners desert is a harsh and unforgiving environment. The extreme temperatures, lack of water, and treacherous terrain pose a constant threat. Dehydration, heatstroke, and injuries are a constant concern. The loose rocks and steep inclines make navigation difficult and dangerous.\n* **Internal Threat:** The glass shard lodged in his shoulder represents an immediate and escalating threat. The wound is painful and bleeding freely. If left untreated, it could lead to infection, blood loss, and ultimately, death. He needs to find a way to stop the bleeding and clean the wound, but doing so will require time and resources he can ill afford. The pain is already starting to cloud his judgment.\n\nENVIRONMENT:\n\nThe Four Corners Research Facility is a sprawling complex carved out of the desolate beauty of the southwestern desert. The architecture is utilitarian and brutalist \u2013 concrete bunkers, corrugated metal structures, and chain-link fences dominate the landscape. The buildings are uniformly drab, painted in shades of grey and olive green, blending seamlessly with the surrounding terrain. There is a distinct lack of vegetation within the facility perimeter, as if the very earth has been poisoned.\n\nThe air is dry and thin, carrying the scent of dust, diesel fumes, and something vaguely metallic. The sun beats down relentlessly, baking the earth and radiating heat off the concrete structures. The silence is broken only by the occasional drone of a distant engine, the rustling of the wind through the scrub brush, and the echo of Jason's own ragged breaths.\n\nThe red mesa is a natural landmark, a towering sandstone formation that provides a commanding view of the surrounding area. Its slopes are steep and treacherous, covered in loose rocks and crumbling shale. The base of the mesa is littered with debris \u2013 discarded equipment, rusted metal scraps, and the occasional bleached bone.\n\nThe sky is a vast, unbroken expanse of blue, offering no solace from the oppressive heat. The clouds are sparse and wispy, providing little shade. The sun is a malevolent eye, watching Jason's every move.\n\nThe facility itself feels like a wound upon the landscape, a scar that refuses to heal. It is a place of secrets and lies, a monument to human ambition and hubris. The chain-link fence that surrounds it is not just a physical barrier, but a symbol of the darkness that lies within.\n\nTONE:\n\nThe tone remains firmly rooted in the aesthetic of 1993 VHS horror. The world is gritty, realistic, and unsettling. The focus is on psychological tension and body horror, rather than jump scares and cheap thrills. The camera is Jason's eyes, seeing the world through his lens, capturing the raw and visceral details of his experience.\n\nThe sense of dread is pervasive, a constant undercurrent that permeates every scene. The environment is hostile and unforgiving, and the characters are flawed and vulnerable. There is a sense that something terrible is about to happen, and that Jason is hopelessly outmatched.\n\nThe use of descriptive language emphasizes the physical sensations \u2013 the heat of the sun, the taste of dust, the smell of blood. The goal is to immerse the player in Jason's experience, making them feel his fear, his pain, and his desperation. The grainy, distorted quality of a well-worn VHS tape informs the overall aesthetic, adding to the sense of unease and verisimilitude. The wound in Jason's shoulder serves as a constant reminder of his vulnerability and the ever-present threat of bodily harm.",
