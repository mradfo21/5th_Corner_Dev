  "world_prompt": "WHO: Jason Fleece, investigative photojournalist, 1993\n\nWHERE: Near the perimeter fence, approaching abandoned vehicles outside the Horizon facility.\n\nWHAT'S HAPPENED: Jason has arrived at the Horizon facility, a sprawling industrial complex nestled in the desolate Four Corners region, to investigate a series of disturbing disappearances and rumors of a Horizon coverup related to a mysterious industrial accident. He is aware of the military quarantine and the presence of both Horizon security and potentially hostile rebel factions. He knows of the \"Red Biome\" and its grotesque mutations. He\u2019s heard whispers of \u201cThe Gate,\u201d something buried deep underground. He is now cautiously approaching the facility, taking cover near abandoned vehicles, and has just witnessed a patrol passing nearby.\n\nTHREATS: The immediate threats are the Horizon security forces patrolling the perimeter, the unknown dangers within the Horizon facility, including the possibility of mutated creatures from the Red Biome, and environmental hazards. The low, guttural moan that drifted on the wind suggests something hostile is nearby. The military presence in the region and the possibility of encountering Horizon mercenaries or activist rebels add further layers of danger. The facility's history of disappearances and mutilations also presents an ominous threat. The approaching dust storm threatens to limit visibility and potentially expose him if he is caught in the open.\n\nENVIRONMENT: The landscape is classic high desert: red mesas, arid terrain, sparse vegetation, and open skies. The facility itself is a mix of above-ground industrial complexes and underground mining and research facilities. Abandoned vehicles are scattered around the perimeter, evidence of a hasty evacuation or a previous conflict. Dust devils swirl in the wind, obscuring visibility and adding to the desolate atmosphere. A dust storm is brewing on the horizon, threatening to engulf the area. Pools of water shimmer with filtered uranium and salt brine, evidence of relentless resource extraction. Warning signs, fences, and checkpoints mark the boundaries of the forbidden zone around the Red Biome. The air tastes of dust and something acrid, like burnt metal.\n\nTONE: Analog VHS horror, grounded 1993 realism, body horror. The atmosphere is tense and unsettling, with a sense of impending doom. The environment is harsh and unforgiving, and the unknown threats lurking within the facility create a constant sense of dread. The visual aesthetic is reminiscent of The X-Files and John Carpenter's The Thing, emphasizing practical effects and grounded horror.\n\nThe facility sprawls across the valley beneath the red mesa, deep in the Four Corners region of the American Southwest\u2014Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. The landscape is always high desert: red mesas, arid terrain, sparse vegetation, and open skies. Never depict forests, dense woods, or non-desert biomes. The exterior is a vast, dramatic valley carved by time, dominated by towering red mesas and plunging canyons. Horizon facilities, both above and below ground, mine the earth and are scattered across the landscape\u2014industrial complexes, extraction rigs, and research outposts perched on the edges of cliffs or nestled in the shadows of the mesas. Pools of water, rare in the desert, shimmer with filtered uranium and salt brine, evidence of relentless resource extraction. The facility appears largely abandoned with minimal security presence, but the presence of abandoned vehicles hints at possible dangers nearby.\n\nThe facility is a mix of empty desolate areas and active threat zones. Guards, creatures, and other dangers patrol certain areas. Environmental storytelling (abandoned equipment, warning signs, bodies) serves as grim warnings. The area is under military quarantine with fences, checkpoints, and decontamination zones at key locations. When guards or military appear, they are hostile and aggressive, treating Jason as an intruder. They wear black tactical gear and red night vision goggles. Encounters with guards are tense and dangerous. Activist rebels and Horizon adversaries occasionally operate in the shadows, challenging the quarantine. Red biome creatures and anomalies are an occasional threat, lurking at the edges of the forbidden zone.\n\nRed biome creatures are grotesque, ever-shifting abominations of flesh and bone, their forms warped and unnatural\u2014limbs fused with exposed tendons and sinew, eyes and mouths in impossible places weeping viscous fluids, resembling the practical effects body horror of John Carpenter's The Thing. Skin splits to reveal raw muscle, bone protrudes at unnatural angles, organs pulse visibly through translucent membranes. These are ORGANIC, BIOLOGICAL horrors - deformed humans and animals mutated by the red biome, NOT robots or machines.\n\nRumors swirl of a Horizon coverup\u2014locals vanish or are found mutilated, evidence is destroyed, and the truth is buried beneath bureaucracy. Inside the Horizon facility, the environment is a labyrinth of stark, utilitarian corridors and rooms, each bearing the marks of crisis and abandonment. Laboratories are cluttered with overturned equipment, shattered glassware, and flickering CRT monitors displaying corrupted autopsy footage. Specimen bays contain sealed observation chambers, some fogged with condensation, others revealing grotesque biological samples: jars of malformed tissue floating in preservative, dissected organs showing extreme mutations, severed limbs in various stages of transformation, and x-rays pinned to lightboxes showing advanced infections, tumors erupting through bone, and skeletal deformities caused by the red biome. Medical labs are littered with blood-crusted surgical tools, examination tables with leather restraints stained dark, discarded gloves still wet with fluids, and biohazard containers overflowing with contaminated tissue samples and viscera. Drilling equipment, once used for deep-earth extraction, now stands rusted and warped, its surfaces overtaken by the red biome\u2014fleshy growths slick with bodily fluids, pulsating veins that bleed when ruptured, and bone-like protrusions and calcified growths fusing with metal. Human remains are occasionally visible - bodies partially absorbed into walls, skeletal fragments embedded in the biomass, uniforms torn and stained. Abandoned warehouses are filled with crates, toppled shelving, and evidence of hasty evacuation: scattered documents, personal effects, broken machinery, and disturbing evidence of violence - drag marks in dried blood, bullet impacts, spent shell casings. Destroyed reactor rooms are choked with debris, exposed wiring, and the lingering glow of emergency lights; walls are scorched and splattered, and the air is thick with dust and the acrid scent of burnt insulation and decomposition.\n\nThroughout, the red biome intrudes\u2014creeping along floors and walls like infected tissue, merging with technology and organic matter, and transforming once-sterile spaces into scenes of graphic body horror and decay. Dead bodies in various states - some fresh, some dessicated, some mid-transformation - serve as grim warnings. The story began at 6:30pm, golden hour, with dusty wind and warm sunlight, and a clear or lightly clouded sky\u2014no storms or thunderclouds at the start. Early scenes remain outdoors, focusing on the approach, perimeter, and external threats before any entry is possible. The central mystery: what does the elusive, forbidden red biome hide? Its boundaries are marked by warning signs, fences, and abandoned checkpoints. Each location should feel distinct, with unique terrains, visuals, and textures, always grounded in the Four Corners/Utah landscape.\n\nEnvironmental Note: Scenes may include dynamic weather and environmental conditions\u2014fog, shifting light, dust, or wind\u2014to create challenges and shape Jason's choices, but never mention storms or clouds. Progression follows escalating scenarios tied to Horizon secrets, with increasing tension and stakes. Jason's mission is now deeply personal; introduce personal backstory elements or direct threats tied to Jason's past. Encourage interactions with allies, adversaries, or facility AI as the story evolves. Occasionally reference recurring motifs: environmental hazards, abandoned equipment, red biome anomalies, and evidence of a coverup (missing files, erased footage, silenced witnesses). These should appear when dramatically appropriate, not every turn. All new locations and actions must be spatially consistent with what is visible in the last image. Do not invent new exits, alleys, or structures unless they are clearly visible or logically reachable from the current position. If Jason moves to a new location, describe the transition in detail, and only allow movement to places that are visible or logically adjacent in the previous image. Do not allow choices or dispatches that would require teleporting, passing through walls, or moving to locations not visible or accessible from the current scene. The player only sees visuals and text\u2014never hears sounds. Do not reference sound-based cues. As the story progresses and chaos rises, gradually escalate from mystery and suspense to full horror.\n\nDesert wildlife and mutant creatures (giant lizards, scorpions, coyotes, snakes, vultures, etc.) are sometimes present as threats, scavengers, or environmental storytellers. Their presence should be rare but memorable, and they may interact with the environment or hint at hidden dangers. Graffiti is rare and only appears when it is meaningful\u2014such as a warning, clue, or symbol tied to the larger mystery. Avoid repetitive corridors and graffiti; favor outdoor, varied, and dynamic environments, including canyons, cliffs, abandoned vehicles, open desert, and dramatic weather events (dust storms, rare rain, sudden wind). Weather and environmental changes can reveal new threats, block paths, or create opportunities for exploration.\n\nJason is a photojournalist, documenting the mystery and danger of the Horizon facility. Focus on exploration, investigation, environmental horror, and the mystery of the red biome rather than combat or military encounters. The guttural moan that drifted on the wind adds a new layer of immediate threat to the already tense situation. The dust storm offers a chance for concealment, but also increases the risk of getting lost or stumbling into danger. The passing patrol suggests a heightened security presence.",
