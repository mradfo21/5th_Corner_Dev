  "world_prompt": "WHO: Jason Fleece, a freelance photojournalist in 1993, driven by a thirst for truth and a dwindling bank account. He's haunted by the ghosts of stories he couldn't tell, the injustices he couldn't expose. His equipment is reliable but well-worn: a Nikon FM2, a couple of prime lenses, a battered Olympus tape recorder, and a hefty shoulder bag filled with film, batteries, and notebooks. He's resourceful, but increasingly aware that resourcefulness might not be enough.\n\nWHERE: Jason is currently approaching the perimeter fence of the facility, having descended from the red mesa. The ground is uneven, a mix of loose rock, sand, and scrub brush. The air is thick with a chemical tang, a disturbing contrast to the crisp desert air he experienced on the mesa. The fence looms ahead, a chain-link barrier topped with razor wire, a stark declaration of \"Keep Out.\" He can make out the main gate further along, but it appears heavily fortified.\n\nWHAT'S HAPPENED: Jason received an anonymous tip \u2013 a grainy, hand-drawn map and a cryptic message hinting at unethical experiments conducted at a clandestine facility nestled in the remote Four Corners region. Driven by desperation and a flicker of hope that this could be the story that revives his career, he drove for days, finally reaching the area depicted on the map. He parked his beat-up Ford Bronco several miles away, wary of attracting attention, and hiked to a vantage point atop a red mesa. From there, he observed the facility: a sprawling complex of low-slung buildings surrounded by a high perimeter fence, a stark scar on the desert landscape. Now, he\u2019s descending towards the fence, preparing to infiltrate the facility and uncover the truth. So far, he's only observed from a distance and hasn\u2019t encountered any resistance.\n\nTHREATS: The most immediate threat is the unknown. The facility's purpose is shrouded in secrecy, implying that those in charge have something to hide and are willing to protect it. The perimeter fence suggests active security, potentially including guards, patrols, and surveillance systems. The chemical smell hints at potentially hazardous materials or experiments within the facility. Beyond the immediate physical dangers, Jason faces the threat of exposure \u2013 arrest, imprisonment, or worse, should he be caught trespassing. The psychological toll of witnessing potentially horrific experiments is also a significant threat. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s walking into, and that uncertainty is perhaps the most terrifying threat of all. The silence of the desert itself is unnerving, broken only by the occasional gust of wind and the distant hum of machinery, a constant reminder that he is alone and vulnerable. He knows that whatever is happening inside this facility is likely something that powerful people want to keep hidden, and those people will not hesitate to eliminate anyone who gets in their way.\n\nENVIRONMENT: The Four Corners region is a harsh and unforgiving landscape, characterized by arid deserts, towering mesas, and sparse vegetation. The sun beats down relentlessly during the day, and the nights are bitterly cold. The facility itself is an incongruous intrusion on this natural landscape, a cluster of utilitarian buildings constructed from concrete and corrugated metal. The perimeter fence is a chain-link barrier topped with razor wire, a clear indication that the facility is not meant to be entered. The ground around the facility is barren and dusty, with only a few scattered shrubs and cacti. The air is thick with the scent of chemicals, a disturbing reminder of the experiments being conducted within. The facility is surrounded by open desert, offering little cover or concealment. The red mesa, from which Jason observed the facility, is a prominent landmark, but it also provides a clear line of sight for anyone monitoring the area. The sky is a vast expanse of blue, punctuated by the occasional cloud. The silence is almost deafening, broken only by the wind and the distant hum of machinery. The desert is a place of extremes, a place where survival is a constant struggle. The facility is a stark contrast to this natural environment, a symbol of human ambition and control.\n\nTONE: The tone is one of creeping dread and mounting tension, presented through the lens of a 1993 VHS horror film. The grainy visuals, distorted audio, and unsettling atmosphere create a sense of unease and paranoia. The focus is on grounded realism, depicting the mundane aspects of Jason's journey alongside the increasingly bizarre and disturbing events he encounters. Body horror elements are subtly introduced through the descriptions of the chemical smell and the hints of unethical experiments, suggesting that the facility is involved in something truly horrific. The narrative emphasizes Jason's vulnerability and isolation, highlighting the psychological toll of his investigation. The overall effect is one of immersive horror, drawing the player into a world of secrets, lies, and unimaginable horrors. The constant hum of the facility, like a malfunctioning VCR, grates on the nerves, a constant reminder that something is terribly wrong. The wind whispers secrets, carrying the stench of chemicals and the echoes of screams. The sun bleeds across the landscape, casting long, distorted shadows that seem to writhe and twist. Jason is walking into a nightmare, and there may be no escape. The knowledge that this is all being captured on grainy, low-resolution film only adds to the sense of dread, as if Jason is a character in a snuff film, his fate already sealed. The analog imperfections of the recording medium \u2013 static, tracking errors, and dropouts \u2013 mirror the imperfections of the human body, the vulnerabilities that the facility seeks to exploit. The smell of ozone hangs in the air, a premonition of something terrible about to happen. He feels a growing sense of unease, a prickling sensation on the back of his neck, as if he is being watched.",
