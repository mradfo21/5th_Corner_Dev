  "world_prompt": "WHO: Jason Fleece, a freelance photojournalist, 34 years old. It's late 1993. You're driven by a need to expose the truth, even if it claws at your sanity. You packed light: a Pentax K1000 camera with a 50mm lens, a battered tape recorder, a flashlight with dying batteries, and a half-empty canteen. Regret weighs heavier than your gear.\n\nWHERE: You're currently stranded in the desolate expanse of the Four Corners desert, specifically just outside the perimeter fence of what appears to be an abandoned, or perhaps not-so-abandoned, government research facility. A rusty, jagged metal spike has impaled your left boot, anchoring you painfully to the ground. The facility gate looms approximately 50 yards ahead, a silent, watchful sentinel.\n\nWHAT'S HAPPENED: Your investigation into missing persons reports and whispered rumors of clandestine experiments led you to this forsaken corner of the American Southwest. You followed a series of cryptic clues \u2013 coded messages on HAM radio frequencies, redacted government documents obtained through a sympathetic contact, and unsettling local legends about strange lights and disappearances near the Four Corners region. The trail ended here, at this facility, shrouded in secrecy and neglect.\n\nYou parked your beat-up Ford Bronco miles away, fearing detection, and trekked across the harsh desert landscape. The sun beat down mercilessly, and the silence was broken only by the occasional mournful cry of a distant coyote. The closer you got, the more palpable the sense of unease became. The air itself seemed to vibrate with a low, almost imperceptible hum.\n\nNow, with your foot pinned to the ground, the facility looms closer than ever, and the initial sense of cautious exploration is rapidly giving way to a primal fear. The setting sun casts long, distorted shadows across the compound, transforming familiar shapes into grotesque parodies.\n\nTHREATS:\n\n*   **The Facility Itself:** The primary threat is the unknown nature of the facility and the experiments conducted within. The facility is not explicitly hostile, but its dilapidated state and the implication of secretive research suggest a high probability of unforeseen dangers, including structural instability, hazardous materials, and potentially\u2026 other things.\n\n*   **Security (Potential):** The figure standing guard at the gate, while currently unmoving, represents a significant potential threat. Their purpose is unknown, but their presence implies security measures and a vested interest in keeping intruders out. They are armed, and their intentions are unclear. The fact that they haven't reacted yet is unnerving.\n\n*   **Environmental Hazards:** The desert environment itself poses a constant threat. Extreme temperatures, dehydration, venomous creatures (scorpions, snakes), and the risk of getting lost are all factors to consider. The rusty spike that has impaled your foot is a testament to the hazardous nature of the environment. Tetanus is now a real concern, adding to the mounting dread.\n\n*   **Unknown Biological/Experimental Threats:** The nature of the research conducted at the facility is unknown, but the rumors and missing persons reports suggest potentially dangerous biological or experimental anomalies. This could include escaped test subjects, mutated creatures, or airborne pathogens. The silence is deafening, but it might be hiding something far more sinister.\n\n*   **The Impaling Spike:** The immediate threat is the rusty metal spike piercing your boot. It immobilizes you, making you vulnerable, and poses a risk of infection. Removing it will be painful and could cause further injury. Leaving it in place leaves you trapped.\n\nENVIRONMENT:\n\nThe Four Corners desert is a harsh, unforgiving landscape. Red rock formations jut out from the sandy ground, sculpted by centuries of wind and erosion. Sparse vegetation clings to life, mostly consisting of cacti, sagebrush, and thorny shrubs. The air is dry and thin, and the sun beats down with relentless intensity.\n\nThe facility itself is a sprawling complex of low-slung buildings, constructed from cinder blocks and corrugated metal. The buildings are uniformly drab and utilitarian, with few windows and a general air of decay. Fences topped with barbed wire surround the perimeter, and warning signs (mostly illegible) are posted at intervals. The gate is a heavy steel structure, secured with a chain and padlock.\n\nThe compound shows signs of long-term neglect. Paint is peeling, rust is rampant, and weeds are growing through cracks in the pavement. Some windows are boarded up, while others are shattered. The overall impression is one of abandonment, but there are subtle signs of recent activity \u2013 a flickering light in one of the buildings, the faint hum of machinery, the figure standing guard. The silence is broken only by the wind whistling through the broken windows and the occasional metallic clang from within the compound.\n\nThe immediate area around you is littered with debris \u2013 discarded equipment, rusty metal scraps, and fragments of broken glass. The spike that has impaled your foot appears to be part of a larger piece of discarded machinery, half-buried in the sand. The ground is uneven and treacherous, making movement difficult even without the added complication of the spike.\n\nThe setting sun casts long, distorted shadows across the landscape, transforming familiar shapes into grotesque parodies. The sky is a fiery orange and red, gradually fading to a deep purple. Stars are beginning to appear, but they offer little comfort in this desolate place.\n\nTONE: The atmosphere is thick with dread and paranoia. The grainy, distorted visuals of the VHS camera amplify the sense of unease, highlighting the imperfections and decay of the environment. The lack of clear information and the constant threat of the unknown create a feeling of helplessness and vulnerability. The body horror element is introduced through the impaling spike, emphasizing the fragility of the human body and the potential for physical harm. The grounded 1993 realism adds to the sense of immersion, making the horror feel more palpable and immediate. The silence is oppressive, broken only by unsettling sounds that hint at unseen dangers. The overall tone is one of growing desperation and impending doom. The hope that drove you here is rapidly fading, replaced by a gnawing fear that you have stumbled into something far beyond your comprehension. The camera's static and occasional glitches mirror your own fraying nerves.",
