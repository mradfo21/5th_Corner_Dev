  "world_prompt": "WHO: Jason Fleece, photojournalist, late 20s. His face is contorted in pain, sweat mingling with the grime of the desert and the blood now soaking his left leg. The initial shock is fading, replaced by a throbbing agony that threatens to overwhelm him. The Nikon FE2, once a symbol of his purpose, feels heavy and useless in his trembling hands. The flash from the photograph still burns in his vision, now tainted with the crimson haze of his own blood. He\u2019s no longer just documenting; he\u2019s fighting for his life. The idealistic journalist is rapidly being replaced by a desperate survivor.\n\nWHERE: Jason is now collapsed a few feet to the left of his previous position, directly adjacent to a section of the perimeter fence that has been twisted into a grotesque sculpture of metal and razor wire. The impact of the rebar has driven him to the ground, and he struggles to maintain his grip on reality. He is closer to the burning facility than before, the heat searing his skin. The ground beneath him is soaked with his blood, a dark stain spreading across the scorched earth. The buckled chain-link offers a sliver of concealment, but it also traps the heat and the toxic fumes. He can feel the vibrations of the explosions in his bones, a constant reminder of the chaos unfolding around him. The stench is unbearable, a nauseating blend of burning flesh, melting plastic, and his own blood.\n\nWHAT'S HAPPENED: Jason arrived in the Four Corners region following an anonymous tip \u2013 a single, unsettling photograph hinting at clandestine experiments within the Horizon facility. Days were spent traversing the desolate landscape in his Ford Bronco, fueled by cheap coffee and a burning desire to uncover the truth. He scouted the facility from a rocky outcrop, meticulously noting guard patrols and potential entry points. He descended, intending to breach the perimeter and expose the facility's secrets. The sky then fractured. A figure in green armor, wielding weapons of impossible technology, descended and unleashed a devastating assault on the facility. Jason, initially frozen in disbelief, witnessed the systematic obliteration of Horizon. His journalistic instincts, battling with his primal need for survival, led him to commit the ultimate act of folly: he photographed the Master Chief in the midst of the carnage. The flash, a desperate attempt to capture the impossible, may have sealed his fate. Now, a piece of rebar, launched by a secondary explosion, has ripped through his leg, plunging him into a new level of terror and vulnerability.\n\nTHREATS:\n\n*   **Master Chief:** The green armored figure remains the paramount threat. His motives are still unknown, but his destructive capabilities are undeniable. He is focused on the facility, but Jason is now undeniably caught in the crossfire, injured and exposed. The photograph he took may have attracted the Master Chief's attention, marking him as a potential obstacle or target. The flash could have been interpreted as a hostile act, triggering a retaliatory response.\n*   **Horizon Security (Remnants):** The facility's security forces are likely scattered and demoralized, but they could still pose a danger. Desperation can make even the most disciplined soldiers unpredictable. Some may have survived the initial onslaught, and their allegiance is now uncertain. They might see Jason as a convenient scapegoat for the facility's destruction, a way to deflect blame and maintain some semblance of control. The photograph could also alert them to his presence, making him a target for elimination.\n*   **The Unknown Experiments (Escaped):** The experiments conducted at Horizon, whatever their nature, may have been released during the attack. The chaos could have breached containment, unleashing horrors beyond human comprehension. The metallic, biological scent is now intensified, mixed with the coppery tang of his own blood and the acrid stench of burning chemicals. The fire may be driving these entities out into the open, forcing them to seek refuge elsewhere... perhaps near the fence, where Jason lies bleeding.\n*   **The Environment (Lethal):** The Four Corners desert, already unforgiving, is now a war zone. The explosions have created new hazards, including collapsing structures, fires, and flying debris. The air is thick with toxic fumes, and the heat is becoming unbearable. Now, the environment has directly wounded him, a physical manifestation of its hostility. The risk of infection is high, given the nature of the wound and the unsanitary conditions.\n*   **Exposure (Critical):** Jason is alone, injured, and without backup. The chaos has made him more visible, more vulnerable. If he is spotted by either the Master Chief or the remnants of Horizon security, his chances of survival are virtually nonexistent. The absence of any communication devices amplifies his isolation. He is a witness to something he was never meant to see, and now he is paying the price.\n*   **The Fence (Breached and Treacherous):** The chain-link fence is now a mangled mess, a testament to the destructive power unleashed upon the facility. While it no longer presents a significant physical barrier, it remains a dangerous obstacle. The possibility of electrification persists, although the power grid is likely unstable. The twisted metal of the fence itself presents a physical hazard, with sharp edges and unstable sections. Now, it is also a grim reminder of his proximity to the chaos, a symbol of his entrapment.\n*   **The Photograph (Incriminating):** Taking the picture was a catastrophic mistake. The flash has exposed him, and the photograph itself is now a potential death warrant. If captured, it could be used as evidence against him, or worse, provide information about the attack to those who might want to suppress it. The photograph is a symbol of his journalistic hubris, a reminder of his failure to prioritize his own survival.\n*   **The Wound (Immediate):** The rebar impaling his leg is the most immediate threat. The pain is excruciating, and the blood loss is significant. He needs to stop the bleeding and treat the wound, but he has no medical supplies. The wound is also a beacon, attracting unwanted attention. Predators, both human and inhuman, might be drawn to the scent of blood.\n\nENVIRONMENT:\n\nThe Four Corners region of the American Southwest, transformed into a scene of apocalyptic devastation. The Horizon facility, once a symbol of sterile secrecy, is now a burning ruin.\n\n*   **The Rocky Outcrop (Irrelevant):** Still behind Jason, a silent witness to the unfolding chaos, but now utterly insignificant. It feels like a distant dream that he was ever up there, an innocent observer. The outcrop is a symbol of his lost innocence, a reminder of the world before the sky ripped open.\n*   **The Perimeter Fence (Tortured):** A twisted, mangled mess of chain-link and razor wire, stained with Jason's blood. Sections have been flattened by explosions, creating gaping holes in the perimeter. The humming vibration is now erratic, replaced by the crackling of electrical fires and the hiss of escaping gas. Patches of the fence glow with an eerie green light, possibly caused by damaged energy conduits. The fence is now a cage, trapping him in the midst of the destruction.\n*   **The Facility Buildings (Infernal):** Low-slung, windowless concrete structures, now engulfed in flames. The architecture, once suggesting containment and secrecy, now speaks of destruction and failure. The large, central building is collapsing, sending plumes of smoke and debris into the sky. The smaller buildings are also burning, their contents unknown. The ventilation systems are silent, replaced by the roar of the fire. Strange, bioluminescent fungi are now visible on the exterior walls of some of the buildings, glowing with an unnatural light amidst the flames. The buildings are now infernos, consuming everything within them.\n*   **The Desert Floor (Bloodied):** Hard-packed sand and gravel, now scorched and littered with debris, soaked with Jason's blood. Footprints are obscured by the chaos. The wind whips across the open ground, carrying ash and embers. The ground trembles with each explosion. Jason's footprints mark his path from the outcrop to the fence, a trail that is now a potential death sentence. The heat radiating from the ground is intense, almost unbearable. The bloodstain is a grim reminder of his vulnerability, a sign that he is wounded and exposed.\n*   **The Air (Poisoned):** The air is thick with smoke, dust, and the stench of burning chemicals. The metallic tang is still present, but now it is overpowered by the smell of burning flesh, plastic, and his own blood. The air crackles with an unholy energy, a residue of the advanced weaponry being used. The flash from the camera seems to have intensified the unnatural luminescence in the air, making it feel even more oppressive. Breathing is becoming increasingly difficult, and the toxic fumes are making him dizzy.\n*   **The Wind (Whispering Death):** A constant presence, the wind now carries the sounds of explosions, gunfire, and what might be screams. The faint, distorted voice is gone, replaced by a cacophony of destruction. The wind also carries the scent of ozone and something else... something sweet and sickly, like rotting fruit, but metallic. It whispers through the ruined fence, carrying the scent of death and decay.\n\nTONE:\n\nThe atmosphere is one of utter chaos, pain, and desperation. Jason is no longer an outsider, but a victim of the impossible. The facility exudes an aura of annihilation, hinting at dark secrets and unspeakable experiments now violently exposed. The grainy, analog aesthetic of 1993 is amplified by the surreal nature of the attack, a reminder of the",
