  "world_prompt": "WHO: Jason Fleece, a freelance photojournalist driven by a thirst for truth and a growing sense of unease, now fighting a rising tide of pain and panic. Armed with his trusty Nikon (useless now, it seems), a worn backpack containing spare film, a half-eaten granola bar, and a rapidly dwindling sense of hope, Jason finds himself embroiled in something far more sinister than he initially imagined. It's 1993, and the world is a simpler place, a place where secrets can still fester in the shadows, especially in the remote corners of the American Southwest. He's in his late 20s, sporting a perpetually tired look and the five o'clock shadow that comes with too much coffee and too little sleep. He bitterly regrets not bringing more water, and now, even more, a decent first-aid kit. He's bleeding, alone, and the smell of ozone is making his head spin.\n\nWHERE: Jason is sprawled on the lower slopes of the red mesa, his descent abruptly halted by a cruel twist of fate. The ochre hues of the rock face loom above him, now seeming less majestic and more like a tomb. He's a mere few dozen feet from the base of the mesa, tantalizingly close to the relative safety of flat ground, but agonizingly far considering his injury. The piece of discarded metal debris, clutched uselessly in his gloved hand, mocks his earlier optimism. The facility\u2019s perimeter fence is still some distance away, a shimmering line in the heat haze, but now it feels like an insurmountable barrier. The rebar, still piercing his lower leg through his protective suit, anchors him to this spot, a prisoner of the unforgiving landscape. A pool of blood is slowly spreading beneath him, staining the red earth a darker crimson.\n\nWHAT'S HAPPENED: So far, Jason's journey has been one of escalating apprehension, culminating in a moment of excruciating pain and vulnerability. He received an anonymous tip, a grainy photograph hinting at bizarre experiments within the Four Corners Research Facility. Driven by a desire to break a big story and fueled by a creeping sense of wrongness emanating from the photo, he drove for hours across the desolate landscape. His arrival at the facility was met with an unsettling silence, broken only by the whisper of the wind and the distant hum of machinery. He scaled the red mesa hoping to get a better view, a lay of the land before venturing closer. From the mesa top, the facility appeared even more ominous, a cluster of decaying buildings surrounded by a high fence. He noticed a sense of wrongness about the place, a sickly feeling that settled in his stomach. Now, the descent has proven disastrous, leaving him injured and exposed. He discovered a piece of discarded metal debris, a potential makeshift weapon, that now seems almost pathetic in its inadequacy. He's bled a substantial amount, and the wound throbs with a sickening pain. The ozone smell, already present, has intensified, suggesting a possible connection to the rebar or the surrounding environment.\n\nTHREATS: The most immediate threat is the injury itself. The rebar impaling his leg could lead to infection, blood loss, or worse, if the metal is contaminated. The possibility of security personnel remains a significant concern, amplified by his cry of pain which echoed across the landscape. Someone, or something, is clearly invested in keeping this place hidden, and they are undoubtedly alerted to his presence now. The facility itself remains a threat \u2013 its decaying infrastructure, potential traps, and the secrets it holds. The ozone-tinged air and metallic smell hint at potential environmental hazards, perhaps the byproducts of whatever experiments are being conducted within the facility. Beyond human or mechanical threats, the nature of the research itself poses a significant danger. The grainy photo suggested experiments that defy natural laws, hinting at monstrous creations and potentially contagious anomalies. Now, a new threat emerges: scavengers. The smell of blood could attract unwanted attention from the desert's predators. The possibility of succumbing to the elements \u2013 dehydration, exposure \u2013 is also a growing concern. He feels increasingly like he's being watched, and the silence seems to press in on him, amplifying his fear. The intensified ozone smell suggests a possible link between his injury and the facility's activities, raising the unsettling possibility that the rebar itself is somehow tainted or connected to the experiments.\n\nENVIRONMENT: The Four Corners region in 1993 is a harsh and unforgiving landscape, now rendered even more hostile by Jason's predicament. Red mesas rise from the desert floor, their imposing presence casting long shadows in the setting sun. Sparse vegetation clings to life, struggling to survive in the arid climate. The air is dry and thin, carrying the scent of dust, sagebrush, and now, the metallic tang of blood and the acrid smell of ozone. The research facility itself is a collection of prefabricated buildings and concrete structures, showing signs of neglect and decay. Paint is peeling, windows are cracked, and rust stains mark the walls. The perimeter fence, topped with barbed wire, is a stark reminder of the facility's isolation and the secrets it guards. The silence is almost deafening, broken only by the occasional gust of wind, the distant hum of machinery emanating from within the buildings, and Jason's ragged breathing. The sky is a vast expanse of blue, slowly turning to orange and purple as the sun dips below the horizon, casting long, distorted shadows that dance around him like mocking figures. The facility is nestled in a shallow valley, making it feel even more isolated and claustrophobic. The discarded metal Jason found is likely a remnant from some sort of accident or failed experiment, adding to the sense of unease and the feeling that something terrible has happened here. The ground is littered with debris, discarded equipment, and the occasional patch of scorched earth. Now, added to this grim tableau, is the pool of Jason's blood, a stark reminder of his vulnerability and the danger he faces. The rebar, embedded in his leg, is rusted and pitted, its surface covered in a strange, iridescent sheen that seems to shimmer in the fading light.\n\nTONE: The atmosphere is now suffocatingly thick with dread and suspense, ratcheted up by Jason's injury and isolation. The situation has moved beyond mere apprehension into the realm of genuine terror. The grainy visuals, the shaky camera work (imagined, of course), and the unsettling sound design are intensified, creating a sense of impending doom. The realism of the 1993 setting grounds the horror, making it feel more believable and relatable. The potential for body horror is no longer just a hint; it's a painful reality. Jason's internal monologue is now a desperate scramble for survival, his desire to uncover the truth overshadowed by the immediate need to escape this nightmare. The slow burn of the narrative has exploded into a desperate fight for survival, with the tension reaching a fever pitch. The metallic smell and ozone in the air are no longer just unsettling; they are actively nauseating, adding a layer of physical discomfort to his fear. The overall tone is one of abject horror, where the unknown is amplified by the very real threat of death. Every shadow seems to hold a threat, and every sound sends a shiver down the spine, now intensified by the searing pain in his leg. The lack of information is no longer just a puzzle; it's a terrifying void that threatens to swallow him whole. The discarded piece of metal is now a symbol of his folly, a reminder of his naivete in the face of such overwhelming danger. The setting sun casts long, distorted shadows, further enhancing the sense of unease and isolation, painting the landscape in hues of blood and despair. He feels overwhelmingly like he's being watched, as if unseen eyes are observing his suffering, waiting for the opportune moment to strike. The iridescent sheen on the rebar adds a layer of surreal horror, suggesting that the injury is not just physical, but potentially something far more sinister.\n\nRECENT EVENTS (last 10 turns):\n- Intro -> No major world state changes.\n- Descend the mesa for a closer look -> Impaled by rebar, significant injury.\n\nDISCOVERED ENTITIES:\nMetal debris, impaling rebar (potentially contaminated)\n\nPLAYER'S LATEST ACTION:\n\u200d\u2642\ufe0f (Implied) Cry out in pain.\n\nCONSEQUENCE OF ACTION:\nCry of pain potentially alerts nearby threats; severe injury limits mobility and increases vulnerability; potential contamination from rebar.",
