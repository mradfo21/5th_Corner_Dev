  "world_prompt": "WHO: Jason Fleece, a freelance photojournalist, 34 years old. Equipped with a Minolta camera, a half-empty backpack containing water, a few granola bars, and a tattered road map of Nevada. Driven by a desperate need to revive his career after a series of professional setbacks and personal tragedies. He's not a survivalist, just a man willing to risk everything for a story.\n\nWHERE: Currently just outside the fenced perimeter of the Four Corners Research Facility, hobbled by a rebar impaling his foot. He's a few yards away from the warning sign heeding people to stay away from the quarantine zone. The sun beats down mercilessly on the cracked asphalt.\n\nWHAT'S HAPPENED: Jason drove for hours across the Nevada desert, following rumors of strange happenings at the Four Corners Research Facility – whispers of experimental programs, government cover-ups, and a mysterious illness that had forced the facility into lockdown. He bypassed the main entrance, opting for a less conspicuous approach through the desolate back roads. He found a break in the outer perimeter fence and cautiously approached what appeared to be the quarantine zone, marked by a hastily erected chain-link fence and a stark warning sign. Common sense and a healthy dose of fear got the better of him; he decided to turn back. That's when the rebar found its mark.\n\nTHREATS:\n\n*   The Quarantine Zone: Marked by ominous warnings, the quarantine zone likely contains the source of the rumored illness or whatever experiments went horribly wrong. The nature of the threat is unknown, but the urgency of the quarantine suggests a high level of danger.\n*   Facility Security: While no guards have been sighted yet, the Four Corners Research Facility is a government installation and likely protected by security personnel. They could be armed, hostile, and actively patrolling the area. Stealth and caution are paramount.\n*   Environmental Hazards: The Nevada desert is a harsh environment, with extreme temperatures, limited water sources, and venomous wildlife. Heatstroke, dehydration, and snakebites are constant threats.\n*   The Unknown Illness: The reason for the quarantine is unknown, but the possibility of a highly contagious and deadly illness cannot be ruled out. Close proximity to the quarantine zone could expose Jason to the pathogen.\n*   Rebar: The immediate threat is the rebar currently lodged in Jason's foot. Infection is a major concern.\n\nENVIRONMENT:\n\nThe landscape is classic Nevada desert: vast, desolate, and unforgiving. Scrub brush and Joshua trees dot the horizon under a merciless sun. The air shimmers with heat.\n\n*   The Outer Perimeter: A chain-link fence, rusted and partially broken in places, surrounds the Four Corners Research Facility. Warning signs, faded and peeling, are sporadically attached, declaring the area a quarantine zone and prohibiting entry.\n*   Cracked Asphalt: The ground beneath Jason's feet is cracked and broken asphalt, remnants of a rarely used access road. Debris – discarded metal scraps, broken glass, and sun-bleached plastic – litters the roadside.\n*   The Quarantine Zone Fence: A more robust chain-link fence, topped with barbed wire, marks the boundary of the quarantine zone. The fence appears relatively new, suggesting it was erected recently. The warning signs on this fence are more explicit, mentioning biohazards and severe penalties for trespassing.\n*   The Four Corners Research Facility: In the distance, Jason can see the main buildings of the facility – a collection of low-slung, windowless concrete structures. A tall communication tower rises from the center of the complex, piercing the sky. The overall impression is one of stark functionality and cold isolation.\n*   The Warning Sign: A weathered sign, barely legible, warns of the quarantine zone. \"RESTRICTED AREA - BIOHAZARD - UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY PROHIBITED\" is scrawled across it in faded red paint. The sign is riddled with bullet holes, adding to the sense of unease.\n\nTONE: The atmosphere is thick with dread and uncertainty. The grainy, washed-out visuals evoke a sense of 1993 VHS horror. The silence of the desert is punctuated by unsettling creaks and groans from the facility in the distance. The body horror aspect is introduced with the rebar impaling Jason's foot, emphasizing his vulnerability and the potential for physical suffering. The focus is on grounded realism and the psychological impact of isolation and fear.\n\nThe pain is sharp and immediate. Jason grits his teeth, a wave of nausea washing over him. He leans heavily on his camera bag for support, his breath coming in ragged gasps. The rebar is thick and deeply embedded in his boot and, undoubtedly, his foot. Blood is already starting to pool around the wound. He tries to pull the rebar out, but the pain is excruciating. He stops, realizing that he'll likely cause more damage by trying to remove it himself. He needs to find a safe place to assess the damage and figure out what to do.\n\nPanic begins to set in. He's alone, injured, and potentially exposed to whatever horrors lurk within the quarantine zone. The sun beats down relentlessly, amplifying his discomfort. He scans the horizon, desperately searching for any sign of civilization or help. There's nothing but the endless expanse of the desert and the looming presence of the Four Corners Research Facility.\n\nHe has to move, but putting weight on his injured foot is almost unbearable. He tries hopping on his good leg, but the uneven terrain makes it difficult and painful. He manages to limp a few steps, but quickly realizes that this is not a sustainable solution. He needs to find something to use as a crutch.\n\nHis eyes fall on a discarded piece of metal pipe lying nearby. It's rusty and bent, but it might be strong enough to support his weight. He struggles to reach it, his injured foot throbbing with every movement. He finally manages to grab the pipe and test its strength. It seems sturdy enough.\n\nUsing the pipe as a crutch, he slowly and painfully makes his way away from the quarantine zone fence. He needs to find a place to hide, a place where he can tend to his wound and plan his next move. The abandoned access road offers little in the way of cover. The best he can hope for is to find some shade under a scrub brush or behind a pile of debris.\n\nAs he limps along, he notices something glinting in the distance. It's small and indistinct, but it catches the sunlight in a way that suggests it might be metal. He squints, trying to get a better look. It's difficult to tell from this distance, but it looks like a vehicle – possibly a car or a truck.\n\nHope flickers within him. If he can reach the vehicle, he might be able to escape this desolate place. But the vehicle is a long way off, and his injury is slowing him down considerably. He doesn't know if he has the strength to make it.\n\nHe also has to consider the possibility that the vehicle is not abandoned. It could belong to someone connected to the Four Corners Research Facility – someone who might not be happy to find him trespassing on their property.\n\nDespite the risks, he decides to head towards the vehicle. It's his only chance of escape. He takes a deep breath, steels his resolve, and continues his agonizing journey across the cracked asphalt. Each step is a victory, a testament to his determination to survive. The sun continues to beat down, the pain in his foot intensifies, and the silence of the desert presses in on him. But he keeps moving, driven by the faint hope of rescue and the burning desire to uncover the truth behind the mysteries of the Four Corners Research Facility. The distant vehicle shimmers in the heat haze, a beacon in the desolate landscape. He focuses on it, ignoring the pain and the fear, and puts one foot in front of the other.",
